    <p>"Captain Ahab," said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing
    surprise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. "Captain Ahab, I have
    heard of Moby Dick&mdash;but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?"</p>

    <p>"Who told thee that?" cried Ahab; then pausing, "Aye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that
    dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye," he shouted with a terrific,
    loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; "Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me;
    made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!" Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he
    shouted out: "Aye, aye! and I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and
    round perdition's flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale
    on both sides of land, and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. What say ye, men,
    will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look brave."</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye!" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the excited old man: "A sharp eye for the white
    whale; a sharp lance for Moby Dick!"</p>

    <p>"God bless ye," he seemed to half sob and half shout. "God bless ye, men. Steward! go draw the great measure of
    grog. But what's this long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not game for Moby
    Dick?"</p>

    <p>"I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the
    business we follow; but I came here to hunt whales, not my commander's vengeance. How many barrels will thy
    vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket
    market."</p>

    <p>"Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a little lower layer. If money's to be the
    measurer, man, and the accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by girdling it with guineas,
    one to every three parts of an inch; then, let me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium
    HERE!"</p>

    <p>"He smites his chest," whispered Stubb, "what's that for? methinks it rings most vast, but hollow."</p>

    <p>"Vengeance on a dumb brute!" cried Starbuck, "that simply smote thee from blindest instinct! Madness! To be
    enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous."</p>

    <p>"Hark ye yet again&mdash;the little lower layer. All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard masks. But in
    each event&mdash;in the living act, the undoubted deed&mdash;there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts
    forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man will strike, strike through the mask!
    How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved
    near to me. Sometimes I think there's naught beyond. But 'tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him
    outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be
    the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of
    blasphemy, man; I'd strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do that, then could I do the other; since
    there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even
    that fair play. Who's over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends' glarings is
    a doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck,
    what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small indignity. I meant not
    to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn&mdash;living, breathing pictures painted
    by the sun. The Pagan leopards&mdash;the unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek, and give no
    reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this matter
    of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general
    hurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. 'Tis but to help strike a fin; no
    wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket,
    surely he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I
    see! the billow lifts thee! Speak, but speak!&mdash;Aye, aye! thy silence, then, THAT voices thee. (ASIDE) Something
    shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without
    rebellion."</p>

    <p>"God keep me!&mdash;keep us all!" murmured Starbuck, lowly.</p>

    <p>But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor
    yet the low laugh from the hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor yet the hollow
    flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts sank in. For again Starbuck's downcast eyes
    lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on; the sails filled out;
    the ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come? But rather are
    ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so much predictions from without, as verifications of the
    foregoing things within. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost necessities in our being, these
    still drive us on.</p>

    <p>"The measure! the measure!" cried Ahab.</p>

    <p>Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he ordered them to produce their weapons. Then
    ranging them before him near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates stood at his
    side with their lances, and the rest of the ship's company formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant
    searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves
    meet the eye of their leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but, alas! only to fall into
    the hidden snare of the Indian.</p>

    <p>"Drink and pass!" he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman. "The crew alone now drink.
    Round with it, round! Short draughts&mdash;long swallows, men; 'tis hot as Satan's hoof. So, so; it goes round
    excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it
    went, this way it comes. Hand it me&mdash;here's a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so brimming life is gulped and
    gone. Steward, refill!</p>
