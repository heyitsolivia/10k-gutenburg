    <p>"Upon my soul, he's been studying Murray's Grammar! Improving his mind, poor fellow! But what's that he says
    now&mdash;hist!"</p>

    <p>"I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."</p>

    <p>"Why, he's getting it by heart&mdash;hist! again."</p>

    <p>"I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look."</p>

    <p>"Well, that's funny."</p>

    <p>"And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I'm a crow, especially when I stand a'top of this
    pine tree here. Caw! caw! caw! caw! caw! caw! Ain't I a crow? And where's the scare-crow? There he stands; two bones
    stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket."</p>

    <p>"Wonder if he means me?&mdash;complimentary!&mdash;poor lad!&mdash;I could go hang myself. Any way, for the
    present, I'll quit Pip's vicinity. I can stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he's too crazy-witty for my
    sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering."</p>

    <p>"Here's the ship's navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire to unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel,
    and what's the consequence? Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught's nailed to the mast
    it's a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he'll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My
    father, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in it; some old
    darkey's wedding ring. How did it get there? And so they'll say in the resurrection, when they come to fish up this
    old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious,
    precious, gold! the green miser'll hoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God goes 'mong the worlds blackberrying. Cook! ho,
    cook! and cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your hoe-cake done!"</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm.</h2>
    <h3>The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.</h3>
    <p>"Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?"</p>

    <p>So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth,
    the old man was standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain, who
    was carelessly reclining in his own boat's bow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of
    sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one
    empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar's surcoat.</p>

    <p>"Hast seen the White Whale!"</p>

    <p>"See you this?" and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone,
    terminating in a wooden head like a mallet.</p>

    <p>"Man my boat!" cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near him&mdash;"Stand by to lower!"</p>

    <p>In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his crew were dropped to the water, and were
    soon alongside of the stranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the moment,
    Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his
    own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a
    thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment's warning. Now, it is no very easy matter for
    anybody&mdash;except those who are almost hourly used to it, like whalemen&mdash;to clamber up a ship's side from a
    boat on the open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then instantaneously
    drop it half way down to the kelson. So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether
    unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly
    eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.</p>

    <p>It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly
    sprang from his luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in the present instance, all
    this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the
    perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for
    at first they did not seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea
    bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because the strange captain, observing at a glance how
    affairs stood, cried out, "I see, I see!&mdash;avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing over the
    cutting-tackle."</p>

    <p>As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous, and the great tackles were
    still aloft, and the massive curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This was quickly
    lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like
    sitting in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the word, held himself fast, and
    at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the
    tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his
    ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and
    crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, "Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake
    bones together!&mdash;an arm and a leg!&mdash;an arm that never can shrink, d'ye see; and a leg that never can run.
    Where did'st thou see the White Whale?&mdash;how long ago?"</p>

    <p>"The White Whale," said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along
    it, as if it had been a telescope; "there I saw him, on the Line, last season."</p>

    <p>"And he took that arm off, did he?" asked Ahab, now sliding down from the capstan, and resting on the
    Englishman's shoulder, as he did so.</p>

    <p>"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?"</p>

    <p>"Spin me the yarn," said Ahab; "how was it?"</p>

    <p>"It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line," began the Englishman. "I was ignorant of the
    White Whale at that time. Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to one of
    them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and milling round so, that my boat's crew could only
    trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a
    bouncing great whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows' feet and wrinkles."</p>
