    <p>Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever saw living whales; and but one of them
    was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the Greenland
    or right-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm
    whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it said, that the
    Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of the whales.
    Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back,
    invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in
    all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference to
    nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale,
    without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a new proclamation. This
    is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,&mdash;the Greenland whale is deposed,&mdash;the great sperm whale now
    reigneth!</p>

    <p>There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you, and at the same
    time, in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale's and Bennett's; both in their time
    surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm
    whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though
    mostly confined to scientific description. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not
    complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted whales, his is an unwritten life.</p>

    <p>Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline
    one for the present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man advances
    to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete; because any human
    thing supposed to be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute
    anatomical description of the various species, or&mdash;in this place at least&mdash;to much of any description. My
    object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the
    builder.</p>

    <p>But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the
    bottom of the sea after them; to have one's hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the
    world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful
    tauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he the (leviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is
    vain! But I have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible
    hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to settle.</p>

    <p>First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the
    fact, that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature, A.D.
    1776, Linnaeus declares, "I hereby separate the whales from the fish." But of my own knowledge, I know that down to
    the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnaeus's express edict, were still found dividing
    the possession of the same seas with the Leviathan.</p>

    <p>The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the waters, he states as follows: "On
    account of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intrantem
    feminam mammis lactantem," and finally, "ex lege naturae jure meritoque." I submitted all this to my friends Simeon
    Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion
    that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.</p>

    <p>Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call
    upon holy Jonah to back me. This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does the
    whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has given you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and
    warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.</p>

    <p>Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to
    come? To be short, then, a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL. There you have him. However contracted,
    that definition is the result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a
    fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first.
    Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or
    up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a
    horizontal position.</p>

    <p>By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea
    creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it
    any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish
    must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host.</p>

    <p>*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the
    Coffins of Nantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy,
    contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not
    spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of
    Cetology.</p>

    <p>First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and
    these shall comprehend them all, both small and large.</p>

    <p>I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.</p>

    <p>As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE; of the OCTAVO, the GRAMPUS; of the DUODECIMO, the
    PORPOISE.</p>

    <p>FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:&mdash;I. The SPERM WHALE; II. the RIGHT WHALE; III.
    the FIN-BACK WHALE; IV. the HUMP-BACKED WHALE; V. the RAZOR-BACK WHALE; VI. the SULPHUR-BOTTOM WHALE.</p>
