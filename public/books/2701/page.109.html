    <p>Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial cavity is continuous with the first
    neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being eight in
    height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As it passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal
    tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course, this canal is filled with
    much the same strangely fibrous substance&mdash;the spinal cord&mdash;as the brain; and directly communicates with
    the brain. And what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain's cavity, the spinal cord remains of
    an undecreasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to
    survey and map out the whale's spine phrenologically? For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness
    of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord.</p>

    <p>But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I would merely assume the spinal theory for a
    moment, in reference to the Sperm Whale's hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the larger
    vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should
    call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the great monster is
    indomitable, you will yet have reason to know.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.</h2>
    <p>The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.</p>

    <p>At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and Germans are now among the least; but here and
    there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in the
    Pacific.</p>

    <p>For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects. While yet some distance from the Pequod,
    she rounded to, and dropping a boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the bows instead
    of the stern.</p>

    <p>"What has he in his hand there?" cried Starbuck, pointing to something wavingly held by the German.
    "Impossible!&mdash;a lamp-feeder!"</p>

    <p>"Not that," said Stubb, "no, no, it's a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he's coming off to make us our coffee, is the
    Yarman; don't you see that big tin can there alongside of him?&mdash;that's his boiling water. Oh! he's all right,
    is the Yarman."</p>

    <p>"Go along with you," cried Flask, "it's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can. He's out of oil, and has come
    a-begging."</p>

    <p>However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the whale-ground, and however much it may
    invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing really happens;
    and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.</p>

    <p>As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all heeding what he had in his hand; but in his
    broken lingo, the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately turning the
    conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night
    in profound darkness&mdash;his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a single flying-fish yet captured to
    supply the deficiency; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a
    CLEAN one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.</p>

    <p>His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his ship's side, when whales were almost
    simultaneously raised from the mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that without
    pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan
    lamp-feeders.</p>

    <p>Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German boats that soon followed him, had
    considerably the start of the Pequod's keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, they
    were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans
    of horses in harness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the
    sea.</p>

    <p>Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped old bull, which by his comparatively
    slow progress, as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted with the
    jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is
    not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed
    their back water must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like
    the swell formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth with a
    choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which
    seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind him to upbubble.</p>

    <p>"Who's got some paregoric?" said Stubb, "he has the stomach-ache, I'm afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre
    of stomach-ache! Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It's the first foul wind I ever knew to blow
    from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must be, he's lost his tiller."</p>

    <p>As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses, careens, buries,
    rolls, and wallows on her way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning over on
    his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he
    had lost that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.</p>

    <p>"Only wait a bit, old chap, and I'll give ye a sling for that wounded arm," cried cruel Flask, pointing to the
    whale-line near him.</p>

    <p>"Mind he don't sling thee with it," cried Starbuck. "Give way, or the German will have him."</p>

    <p>With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish, because not only was he the largest,
    and therefore the most valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were going with such great
    velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At this juncture the Pequod's keels had shot by the
    three German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had, Derick's boat still led the chase, though
    every moment neared by his foreign rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being already so nigh to his
    mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he
    seemed quite confident that this would be the case, and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder
    at the other boats.</p>
