    <p>"I think I remember some such story as you were telling," said Flask, when at last the two boats were slowly
    advancing with their burden towards the ship, "but I can't remember where."</p>

    <p>"Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soladoes? Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye
    did?"</p>

    <p>"No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was
    speaking of just now, was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?"</p>

    <p>"Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn't the devil live for ever; who ever heard that the devil
    was dead? Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to get into
    the admiral's cabin, don't you suppose he can crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?"</p>

    <p>"How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?"</p>

    <p>"Do you see that mainmast there?" pointing to the ship; "well, that's the figure one; now take all the hoops in
    the Pequod's hold, and string along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn't begin to be
    Fedallah's age. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn't show hoops enough to make oughts enough."</p>

    <p>"But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you
    got a good chance. Now, if he's so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to live for ever,
    what good will it do to pitch him overboard&mdash;tell me that?</p>

    <p>"Give him a good ducking, anyhow."</p>

    <p>"But he'd crawl back."</p>

    <p>"Duck him again; and keep ducking him."</p>

    <p>"Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though&mdash;yes, and drown you&mdash;what then?"</p>

    <p>"I should like to see him try it; I'd give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn't dare to show his face
    in the admiral's cabin again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and hereabouts on
    the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn the devil, Flask; so you suppose I'm afraid of the devil? Who's afraid
    of him, except the old governor who daresn't catch him and put him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him
    go about kidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil kidnapped, he'd roast for
    him? There's a governor!"</p>

    <p>"Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?"</p>

    <p>"Do I suppose it? You'll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I
    see anything very suspicious going on, I'll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say&mdash;Look here,
    Beelzebub, you don't do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I'll make a grab into his pocket for his tail,
    take it to the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at the
    stump&mdash;do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he'll sneak off
    without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs."</p>

    <p>"And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?"</p>

    <p>"Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;&mdash;what else?"</p>

    <p>"Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?"</p>

    <p>"Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship."</p>

    <p>The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where fluke chains and other necessaries were
    already prepared for securing him.</p>

    <p>"Didn't I tell you so?" said Flask; "yes, you'll soon see this right whale's head hoisted up opposite that
    parmacetti's."</p>

    <p>In good time, Flask's saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale's
    head, now, by the counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may well
    believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke's head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in
    Kant's and you come back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye
    foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and right.</p>

    <p>In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the ship, the same preliminary proceedings
    commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole, but in
    the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone
    attached to what is called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case, had been done. The carcases
    of both whales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of
    overburdening panniers.</p>

    <p>Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale's head, and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles
    there to the lines in his own hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while, if the
    Parsee's shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and lengthen Ahab's. As the crew toiled on,
    Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing things.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale's Head&mdash;Contrasted View.</h2>
    <p>Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join them, and lay together our own.</p>

    <p>Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They
    are the only whales regularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all the known
    varieties of the whale. As the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head
    of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we may freely go from one to the other, by merely
    stepping across the deck:&mdash;where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical
    cetology than here?</p>

    <p>In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these heads. Both are massive enough in all
    conscience; but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the Right Whale's sadly lacks.
    There is more character in the Sperm Whale's head. As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority
    to him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and
    salt colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what the
    fishermen technically call a "grey-headed whale."</p>

    <p>Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads&mdash;namely, the two most important organs, the eye and
    the ear. Far back on the side of the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if you narrowly
    search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all
    proportion is it to the magnitude of the head.</p>
