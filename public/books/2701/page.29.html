    <p>"What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?"</p>

    <p>"Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye hav'n't seen him yet, have ye?"</p>

    <p>"No, we hav'n't. He's sick they say, but is getting better, and will be all right again before long."</p>

    <p>"All right again before long!" laughed the stranger, with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh. "Look ye; when
    Captain Ahab is all right, then this left arm of mine will be all right; not before."</p>

    <p>"What do you know about him?"</p>

    <p>"What did they TELL you about him? Say that!"</p>

    <p>"They didn't tell much of anything about him; only I've heard that he's a good whale-hunter, and a good captain
    to his crew."</p>

    <p>"That's true, that's true&mdash;yes, both true enough. But you must jump when he gives an order. Step and growl;
    growl and go&mdash;that's the word with Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off Cape
    Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the
    Spaniard afore the altar in Santa?&mdash;heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver calabash he spat
    into? And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage, according to the prophecy. Didn't ye hear a word about them
    matters and something more, eh? No, I don't think ye did; how could ye? Who knows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess.
    But hows'ever, mayhap, ye've heard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say.
    Oh yes, THAT every one knows a'most&mdash;I mean they know he's only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other
    off."</p>

    <p>"My friend," said I, "what all this gibberish of yours is about, I don't know, and I don't much care; for it
    seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship
    there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about the loss of his leg."</p>

    <p>"ALL about it, eh&mdash;sure you do?&mdash;all?"</p>

    <p>"Pretty sure."</p>

    <p>With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled
    reverie; then starting a little, turned and said:&mdash;"Ye've shipped, have ye? Names down on the papers? Well,
    well, what's signed, is signed; and what's to be, will be; and then again, perhaps it won't be, after all. Anyhow,
    it's all fixed and arranged a'ready; and some sailors or other must go with him, I suppose; as well these as any
    other men, God pity 'em! Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I'm sorry I stopped
    ye."</p>

    <p>"Look here, friend," said I, "if you have anything important to tell us, out with it; but if you are only trying
    to bamboozle us, you are mistaken in your game; that's all I have to say."</p>

    <p>"And it's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way; you are just the man for him&mdash;the
    likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates, morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell 'em I've concluded not to make one of
    'em."</p>

    <p>"Ah, my dear fellow, you can't fool us that way&mdash;you can't fool us. It is the easiest thing in the world for
    a man to look as if he had a great secret in him."</p>

    <p>"Morning to ye, shipmates, morning."</p>

    <p>"Morning it is," said I. "Come along, Queequeg, let's leave this crazy man. But stop, tell me your name, will
    you?"</p>

    <p>"Elijah."</p>

    <p>Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor;
    and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred
    yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,
    though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind,
    but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did. He did;
    and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This
    circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all
    kinds of vague wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and the leg
    he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the
    ship the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a
    hundred other shadowy things.</p>

    <p>I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging us or not, and with that intent
    crossed the way with Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without seeming to
    notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a
    humbug.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 20. All Astir.</h2>
    <p>A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod. Not only were the old sails being mended,
    but new sails were coming on board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything betokened that
    the ship's preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam
    keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores; and the men
    employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall.</p>

    <p>On the day following Queequeg's signing the articles, word was given at all the inns where the ship's company
    were stopping, that their chests must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the vessel might
    be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems
    they always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail for several days. But no wonder; there
    was a good deal to be done, and there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod was fully
    equipped.</p>

    <p>Every one knows what a multitude of things&mdash;beds, sauce-pans, knives and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins,
    nut-crackers, and what not, are indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which
    necessitates a three-years' housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers,
    and bankers. And though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as with
    whalemen. For besides the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of
    the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented, it must be
    remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the
    destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats,
    spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain and duplicate
    ship.</p>
