    <p>Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in
    their strangeness, to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan arm thrown round me. But at
    length all the past night's events soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to the
    comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm&mdash;unlock his bridegroom clasp&mdash;yet, sleeping as he
    was, he still hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse
    him&mdash;"Queequeg!"&mdash;but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a
    horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by
    the savage's side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange
    house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! "Queequeg!&mdash;in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!"
    At length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a
    fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his
    arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff,
    looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim
    consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him,
    having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind
    seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped
    out upon the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress
    first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the
    circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy,
    say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg,
    because he treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him
    from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.
    Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding.</p>

    <p>He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one, by the by, and then&mdash;still minus
    his trowsers&mdash;he hunted up his boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next
    movement was to crush himself&mdash;boots in hand, and hat on&mdash;under the bed; when, from sundry violent
    gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I ever
    heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in
    the transition stage&mdash;neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized to show off his
    outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If
    he had not been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but
    then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At
    last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began creaking and limping about
    the room, as if, not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones&mdash;probably not made
    to order either&mdash;rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.</p>

    <p>Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the street being very narrow, the house opposite
    commanded a plain view into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made, staving
    about with little else but his hat and boots on; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat,
    and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At
    that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my amazement, contented himself
    with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of
    hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to
    see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden
    stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall,
    begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers's best
    cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel
    the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.</p>

    <p>The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot
    monkey jacket, and sporting his harpoon like a marshal's baton.</p>

    <p>I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly. I
    cherished no malice towards him, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
    bedfellow.</p>

    <p>However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good thing; the more's the pity. So, if any
    one man, in his own proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let him
    cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable
    about him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.</p>

    <p>The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as yet
    had a good look at. They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea
    carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company,
    with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.</p>
