    <p>By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having a coronation; since he might now consider
    his father dead and gone, he being very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet; and added that
    he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of
    thirty pagan Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,&mdash;as soon as he felt himself baptized
    again. For the nonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They had made a
    harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.</p>

    <p>I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future movements. He answered, to go to sea again,
    in his old vocation. Upon this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my intention to sail
    out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved
    to accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess
    with me, in short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds. To
    all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer,
    and as such, could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of
    whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.</p>

    <p>His story being ended with his pipe's last dying puff, Queequeg embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine,
    and blowing out the light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.</h2>
    <p>Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber, for a block, I settled my own and
    comrade's bill; using, however, my comrade's money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly
    tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg&mdash;especially as Peter Coffin's cock
    and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied
    with.</p>

    <p>We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg's canvas sack
    and hammock, away we went down to "the Moss," the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf. As we were
    going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much&mdash;for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in
    their streets,&mdash;but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we heeded them not, going along
    wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked
    him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own
    harpoons. To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular
    affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply
    intimate with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers' meadows
    armed with their own scythes&mdash;though in no wise obliged to furnish them&mdash;even so, Queequeg, for his own
    private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.</p>

    <p>Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen.
    It was in Sag Harbor. The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest to his
    boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the thing&mdash;though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the
    precise way in which to manage the barrow&mdash;Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then shoulders
    the barrow and marches up the wharf. "Why," said I, "Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would
    think. Didn't the people laugh?"</p>

    <p>Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts
    express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and this punchbowl
    always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant
    ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander&mdash;from all accounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at
    least for a sea captain&mdash;this commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg's sister, a pretty young
    princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo cottage, this
    Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of honour, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between
    the High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg's father. Grace being said,&mdash;for those people have their
    grace as well as we&mdash;though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our platters,
    they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts&mdash;Grace, I say, being
    said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated
    and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the
    Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking himself&mdash;being Captain of a ship&mdash;as having plain precedence
    over a mere island King, especially in the King's own house&mdash;the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in
    the punchbowl;&mdash;taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. "Now," said Queequeg, "what you tink
    now?&mdash;Didn't our people laugh?"</p>

    <p>At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the
    Acushnet river. On one side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the
    clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the
    world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and
    coopers, with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the
    start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third,
    and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.</p>

    <p>Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows,
    as a young colt his snortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!&mdash;how I spurned that turnpike earth!&mdash;that
    common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of
    the sea which will permit no records.</p>
