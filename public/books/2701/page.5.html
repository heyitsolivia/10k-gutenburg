    <p>Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what else to do with myself, I resolved to
    spend the rest of the evening as a looker on.</p>

    <p>Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord cried, "That's the Grampus's crew. I seed
    her reported in the offing this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we'll have the
    latest news from the Feegees."</p>

    <p>A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners
    enough. Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all bedarned and
    ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed
    from their boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the
    whale's mouth&mdash;the bar&mdash;when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out
    brimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin
    and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long
    standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side of an ice-island.</p>

    <p>The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with the arrantest topers newly landed from
    sea, and they began capering about most obstreperously.</p>

    <p>I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the
    hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the
    rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate
    (though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here venture upon a little
    description of him. He stood full six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have
    seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the
    contrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.
    His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those
    tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its
    height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few
    minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them,
    they raised a cry of "Bulkington! Bulkington! where's Bulkington?" and darted out of the house in pursuit of
    him.</p>

    <p>It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to
    congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.</p>

    <p>No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother. I
    don't know how it is, but people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping with an
    unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections
    indefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than
    anybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all
    sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep
    in your own skin.</p>

    <p>The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to
    presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly
    none of the finest. I began to twitch all over. Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be
    home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight&mdash;how could I tell from what vile
    hole he had been coming?</p>

    <p>"Landlord! I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.&mdash;I shan't sleep with him. I'll try the bench
    here."</p>

    <p>"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board
    here"&mdash;feeling of the knots and notches. "But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's plane there in
    the bar&mdash;wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough." So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk
    handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape. The
    shavings flew right and left; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was
    near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven's sake to quit&mdash;the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I
    did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the shavings
    with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his business, and
    left me in a brown study.</p>

    <p>I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short; but that could be mended with a
    chair. But it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed
    one&mdash;so there was no yoking them. I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against
    the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon found that there came such a
    draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially as
    another current from the rickety door met the one from the window, and both together formed a series of small
    whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.</p>

    <p>The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I steal a march on him&mdash;bolt his door inside,
    and jump into his bed, not to be wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon second
    thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the
    harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!</p>

    <p>Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other
    person's bed, I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown
    harpooneer. Thinks I, I'll wait awhile; he must be dropping in before long. I'll have a good look at him then, and
    perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all&mdash;there's no telling.</p>
