    <p>"Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope my poor mother's drawn my part-pay ere
    this; if not, few coppers will now come to her, for the voyage is up."</p>

    <p>From the ship's bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers, bits of plank, lances, and harpoons,
    mechanically retained in their hands, just as they had darted from their various employments; all their enchanted
    eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band
    of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his
    whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship's
    starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell flat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the
    harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as mountain
    torrents down a flume.</p>

    <p>"The ship! The hearse!&mdash;the second hearse!" cried Ahab from the boat; "its wood could only be
    American!"</p>

    <p>Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot
    to the surface again, far off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab's boat, where, for a time, he lay
    quiescent.</p>

    <p>"I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy hammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of
    mine; thou uncracked keel; and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed
    prow,&mdash;death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and without me? Am I cut off from the last fond pride of
    meanest shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my
    topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone life, and
    top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last
    I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all
    coffins and all hearses to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still
    chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! THUS, I give up the spear!"</p>

    <p>The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting velocity the line ran through the
    grooves;&mdash;ran foul. Ahab stooped to clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the neck,
    and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone.
    Next instant, the heavy eye-splice in the rope's final end flew out of the stark-empty tub, knocked down an oarsman,
    and smiting the sea, disappeared in its depths.</p>

    <p>For an instant, the tranced boat's crew stood still; then turned. "The ship? Great God, where is the ship?" Soon
    they through dim, bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata Morgana; only the
    uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the
    pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea. And now, concentric circles seized the lone
    boat itself, and all its crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning, animate and inanimate, all
    round and round in one vortex, carried the smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.</p>

    <p>But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast,
    leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly
    undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they almost touched;&mdash;at that instant, a red
    arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster
    to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home among
    the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced to intercept its broad
    fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the submerged
    savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic
    shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with
    his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and
    helmeted herself with it.</p>

    <p>Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides; then
    all collapsed, and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Epilogue</h2>
    <h3>"AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE" Job.</h3>
    <p>The drama's done. Why then here does any one step forth?&mdash;Because one did survive the wreck.</p>

    <p>It so chanced, that after the Parsee's disappearance, I was he whom the Fates ordained to take the place of
    Ahab's bowsman, when that bowsman assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three men were
    tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in
    full sight of it, when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the
    closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting
    towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve.
    Till, gaining that vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring,
    and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell
    over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and
    dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks
    sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the
    devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing children, only found another orphan.</p>
