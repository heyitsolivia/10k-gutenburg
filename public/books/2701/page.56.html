    <p>Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a
    still greater number who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of any
    certain calamity, and without superstitious accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
    offered.</p>

    <p>One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the
    superstitiously inclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had actually been
    encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.</p>

    <p>Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious
    probability. For as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most erudite
    research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his
    pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,
    especially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports himself with such
    vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.</p>

    <p>It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as well a thing placed upon authoritative
    record years ago by Scoresby, that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies have
    been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these
    instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many
    days. Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the Nor' West Passage, so long a problem to
    man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the real living experience of living men, the prodigies
    related in old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which
    the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near
    Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage); these fabulous
    narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.</p>

    <p>Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults,
    the White Whale had escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further
    in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in
    time); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed
    he should ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in
    unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.</p>

    <p>But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable
    character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk
    that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out&mdash;a peculiar snow-white
    wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even
    in the limitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.</p>

    <p>The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he
    had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid aspect,
    when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with
    golden gleamings.</p>

    <p>Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested
    the whale with natural terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific accounts, he
    had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than
    perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had
    several times been known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to splinters,
    or drive them back in consternation to their ship.</p>

    <p>Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar disasters, however little bruited ashore,
    were by no means unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale's infernal aforethought
    of ferocity, that every dismembering or death that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an
    unintelligent agent.</p>

    <p>Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled,
    when amid the chips of chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds of the
    whale's direful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.</p>

    <p>His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the eddies; one captain, seizing the
    line-knife from his broken prow, had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking with a
    six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly
    sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab's leg, as a mower a blade of grass
    in the field. No turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice. Small
    reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild
    vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify
    with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam
    before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them,
    till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been from the
    beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of
    the east reverenced in their statue devil;&mdash;Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them; but deliriously
    transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most
    maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews
    and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly
    personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the
    general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst
    his hot heart's shell upon it.</p>
