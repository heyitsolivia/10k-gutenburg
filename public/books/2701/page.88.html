    <p>Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub, and passing round
    the loggerhead there, is again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or
    handle of every man's oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they
    alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat,
    where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it hangs in
    a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called
    box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and
    is then attached to the short-warp&mdash;the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to
    that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.</p>

    <p>Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils, twisting and writhing around it in almost
    every direction. All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid eye of the landsman,
    they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal
    woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar,
    bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible contortions be put in play
    like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to
    quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit&mdash;strange thing! what cannot habit accomplish?&mdash;Gayer sallies,
    more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over
    the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman's nooses; and, like the six burghers of
    Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every
    neck, as you may say.</p>

    <p>Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters&mdash;some few
    of which are casually chronicled&mdash;of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.
    For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold
    whizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you. It is worse;
    for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you are
    pitched one way and the other, without the slightest warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and
    simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with where the
    all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out.</p>

    <p>Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful
    than the storm itself; for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in
    itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful
    repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play&mdash;this is
    a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men
    live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift,
    sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life. And if you be a
    philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though
    seated before your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.</h2>
    <p>If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to Queequeg it was quite a different
    object.</p>

    <p>"When you see him 'quid," said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat, "then you quick see
    him 'parm whale."</p>

    <p>The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special to engage them, the Pequod's crew could
    hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we
    then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises,
    dolphins, flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than those off the Rio de la Plata, or
    the in-shore ground off Peru.</p>

    <p>It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds,
    to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that dreamy mood
    losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum
    will, long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.</p>

    <p>Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were
    already drowsy. So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing that we made
    there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across
    the wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.</p>

    <p>Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible,
    gracious agency preserved me; with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty fathoms off,
    a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an
    Ethiopian hue, glistening in the sun's rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in the trough of the sea, and ever
    and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm
    afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some enchanter's wand, the sleepy ship and every
    sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel,
    simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and
    regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.</p>

    <p>"Clear away the boats! Luff!" cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he dashed the helm down before the helmsman
    could handle the spokes.</p>
