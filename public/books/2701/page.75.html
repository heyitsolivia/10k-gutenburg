    <p>But what is a GAM? You might wear out your index-finger running up and down the columns of dictionaries, and
    never find the word. Dr. Johnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster's ark does not hold it.
    Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true
    born Yankees. Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the Lexicon. With that view, let me
    learnedly define it.</p>

    <p>GAM. NOUN&mdash;A SOCIAL MEETING OF TWO (OR MORE) WHALESHIPS, GENERALLY ON A CRUISING-GROUND; WHEN, AFTER
    EXCHANGING HAILS, THEY EXCHANGE VISITS BY BOATS' CREWS; THE TWO CAPTAINS REMAINING, FOR THE TIME, ON BOARD OF ONE
    SHIP, AND THE TWO CHIEF MATES ON THE OTHER.</p>

    <p>There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here. All professions have their own
    little peculiarities of detail; so has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the captain
    is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there,
    and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner's tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons. But the
    whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling
    captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the
    whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat's crew must leave the
    ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the
    occasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree. And
    often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of
    the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his
    legs. Nor is this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and
    then in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus completely
    wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden,
    violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of foundation is nothing without
    corresponding breadth. Merely make a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again, it would
    never do in plain sight of the world's riveted eyes, it would never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be
    seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands; indeed, as token of his
    entire, buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands in his trowsers' pockets; but perhaps being generally
    very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well
    authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden
    squall say&mdash;to seize hold of the nearest oarsman's hair, and hold on there like grim death.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho's Story.</h2>
    <p>(AS TOLD AT THE GOLDEN INN)</p>

    <p>The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is much like some noted four corners of a
    great highway, where you meet more travellers than in any other part.</p>

    <p>It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was
    encountered. She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of
    Moby Dick. To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the
    Town-Ho's story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of
    those so called judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter circumstance, with its
    own particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never
    reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the
    Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems,
    communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his
    sleep, and revealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest.
    Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full
    knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept
    the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod's main-mast. Interweaving in its proper
    place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now
    proceed to put on lasting record.</p>

    <p>*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head, still used by whalemen in hunting the
    famous Gallipagos terrapin.</p>

    <p>For my humor's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my
    Spanish friends, one saint's eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those fine
    cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding
    questions they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.</p>

    <p>"Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho,
    Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days' sail eastward from the eaves of
    this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according
    to daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common. They supposed a sword-fish had
    stabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in
    those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all
    dangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather
    heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals;
    but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So
    much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the
    islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.</p>
