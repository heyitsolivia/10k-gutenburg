    <p>"Captain Peleg," said I, "I have a friend with me who wants to ship too&mdash;shall I bring him down
    to-morrow?"</p>

    <p>"To be sure," said Peleg. "Fetch him along, and we'll look at him."</p>

    <p>"What lay does he want?" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in which he had again been burying
    himself.</p>

    <p>"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad," said Peleg. "Has he ever whaled it any?" turning to me.</p>

    <p>"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg."</p>

    <p>"Well, bring him along then."</p>

    <p>And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done a good morning's work, and that
    the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.</p>

    <p>But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained
    unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on
    board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so
    prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing
    concernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till
    all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself
    into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.</p>

    <p>"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It's all right enough; thou art shipped."</p>

    <p>"Yes, but I should like to see him."</p>

    <p>"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present. I don't know exactly what's the matter with him; but he keeps
    close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don't look so. In fact, he ain't sick; but no, he isn't well
    either. Any how, young man, he won't always see me, so I don't suppose he will thee. He's a queer man, Captain
    Ahab&mdash;so some think&mdash;but a good one. Oh, thou'lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He's a grand,
    ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn't speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye,
    be forewarned; Ahab's above the common; Ahab's been in colleges, as well as 'mong the cannibals; been used to deeper
    wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest
    and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain't Captain Bildad; no, and he ain't Captain Peleg; HE'S AHAB,
    boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!"</p>

    <p>"And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?"</p>

    <p>"Come hither to me&mdash;hither, hither," said Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost startled me.
    "Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself. 'Twas a
    foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old
    squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may
    tell thee the same. I wish to warn thee. It's a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I've sailed with him as mate years
    ago; I know what he is&mdash;a good man&mdash;not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good
    man&mdash;something like me&mdash;only there's a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very
    jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp
    shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he
    lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he's been a kind of moody&mdash;desperate moody, and savage
    sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man, it's better to
    sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee&mdash;and wrong not Captain Ahab,
    because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife&mdash;not three voyages wedded&mdash;a
    sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any
    utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!"</p>

    <p>As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled
    me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy and a
    sorrow for him, but for I don't know what, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange
    awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was.
    But I felt it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in
    him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then. However, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so
    that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.</h2>
    <p>As Queequeg's Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all day, I did not choose to disturb him till
    towards night-fall; for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody's religious obligations, never mind how
    comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or
    those other creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other
    planets, bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions
    yet owned and rented in his name.</p>

    <p>I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly
    superior to other mortals, pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these subjects. There was
    Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;&mdash;but what of that?
    Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content; and there let him rest. All our
    arguing with him would not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all&mdash;Presbyterians and Pagans
    alike&mdash;for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.</p>

    <p>Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over, I went up to his room
    and knocked at the door; but no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside. "Queequeg," said I softly
    through the key-hole:&mdash;all silent. "I say, Queequeg! why don't you speak? It's I&mdash;Ishmael." But all
    remained still as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought he might have had
    an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole
    prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the
    wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg's harpoon,
    which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. That's strange,
    thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it,
    therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.</p>
