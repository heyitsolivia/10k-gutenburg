    <p>Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two firm fortresses, which, in all human
    probability, will for ever remain impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss have
    retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can
    at last resort to their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there, come up among
    icy fields and floes; and in a charmed circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.</p>

    <p>But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot, some philosophers of the
    forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions. But
    though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than 13,000, have been annually slain on the nor'-west
    coast by the Americans alone; yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no
    account as an opposing argument in this matter.</p>

    <p>Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the
    globe, yet what shall we say to Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the King of Siam
    took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And
    there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted for thousands of years, by
    Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive monarchs of the East&mdash;if they still survive there
    in great numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture to expatiate in, which
    is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of the sea
    combined.</p>

    <p>Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of whales, their probably attaining the age
    of a century and more, therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations must be contemporary.
    And what that is, we may soon gain some idea of, by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of
    creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and
    adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe.</p>

    <p>Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his species, however perishable in his
    individuality. He swam the seas before the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries, and
    Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah's flood he despised Noah's Ark; and if ever the world is to be again
    flooded, like the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will still survive, and rearing upon the
    topmost crest of the equatorial flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 106. Ahab's Leg.</h2>
    <p>The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby of London, had not been unattended
    with some small violence to his own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory
    leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so
    vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it was, as ever, something about his not steering
    inflexibly enough); then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench, that though it
    still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.</p>

    <p>And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times
    give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not been very long prior
    to the Pequod's sailing from Nantucket, that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and
    insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his ivory limb having been so
    violently displaced, that it had stake-wise smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme
    difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.</p>

    <p>Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the anguish of that then present suffering
    was but the direct issue of a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous reptile of
    the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity,
    all miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry
    and posterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it is an
    inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to
    them for the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all hell's despair;
    whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of
    griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the
    thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness
    lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so
    do their diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal
    miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of all the glad,
    hay-making suns, and soft cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the gods themselves
    are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the
    signers.</p>

    <p>Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more properly, in set way, have been disclosed
    before. With many other particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some, why it was, that for
    a certain period, both before and after the sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such
    Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble
    senate of the dead. Captain Peleg's bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though, indeed, as
    touching all Ahab's deeper part, every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light.
    But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at the bottom of his
    temporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason,
    possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above hinted
    casualty&mdash;remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab&mdash;invested itself with terrors, not
    entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails. So that, through their zeal for him, they had all
    conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it was, that not
    till a considerable interval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the Pequod's decks.</p>
