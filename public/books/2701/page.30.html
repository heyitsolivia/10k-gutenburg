    <p>At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the Pequod had been almost completed;
    comprising her beef, bread, water, fuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time there was a
    continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things, both large and small.</p>

    <p>Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad's sister, a lean old lady of a most
    determined and indefatigable spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if SHE could help it,
    nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come on board
    with a jar of pickles for the steward's pantry; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate's desk, where
    he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one's rheumatic back. Never did any woman
    better deserve her name, which was Charity&mdash;Aunt Charity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity
    did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that
    promised to yield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was
    concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of well-saved dollars.</p>

    <p>But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board, as she did the last day, with a
    long oil-ladle in one hand, and a still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg
    at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh
    arrival, down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of
    his whalebone den, roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then
    concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.</p>

    <p>During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft, and as often I asked about Captain
    Ahab, and how he was, and when he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would answer, that he
    was getting better and better, and was expected aboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad,
    could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest with myself, I
    would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage,
    without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out
    upon the open sea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the
    matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I said
    nothing, and tried to think nothing.</p>

    <p>At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I
    took a very early start.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.</h2>
    <p>It was nearly six o'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we drew nigh the wharf.</p>

    <p>"There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right," said I to Queequeg, "it can't be shadows; she's off
    by sunrise, I guess; come on!"</p>

    <p>"Avast!" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders,
    and then insinuating himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely
    peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.</p>

    <p>"Going aboard?"</p>

    <p>"Hands off, will you," said I.</p>

    <p>"Lookee here," said Queequeg, shaking himself, "go 'way!"</p>

    <p>"Ain't going aboard, then?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, we are," said I, "but what business is that of yours? Do you know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little
    impertinent?"</p>

    <p>"No, no, no; I wasn't aware of that," said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the
    most unaccountable glances.</p>

    <p>"Elijah," said I, "you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We are going to the Indian and Pacific
    Oceans, and would prefer not to be detained."</p>

    <p>"Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?"</p>

    <p>"He's cracked, Queequeg," said I, "come on."</p>

    <p>"Holloa!" cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few paces.</p>

    <p>"Never mind him," said I, "Queequeg, come on."</p>

    <p>But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my shoulder, said&mdash;"Did ye see anything
    looking like men going towards that ship a while ago?"</p>

    <p>Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, "Yes, I thought I did see four or five men; but
    it was too dim to be sure."</p>

    <p>"Very dim, very dim," said Elijah. "Morning to ye."</p>

    <p>Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and touching my shoulder again, said, "See if
    you can find 'em now, will ye?</p>

    <p>"Find who?"</p>

    <p>"Morning to ye! morning to ye!" he rejoined, again moving off. "Oh! I was going to warn ye against&mdash;but
    never mind, never mind&mdash;it's all one, all in the family too;&mdash;sharp frost this morning, ain't it? Good-bye
    to ye. Shan't see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it's before the Grand Jury." And with these cracked words he
    finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.</p>

    <p>At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin
    entrance was locked within; the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward to the
    forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a light, we went down, and found only an old rigger
    there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his face downwards and
    inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber slept upon him.</p>

    <p>"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?" said I, looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it
    seemed that, when on the wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would have thought
    myself to have been optically deceived in that matter, were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question. But
    I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up
    with the body; telling him to establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper's rear, as though
    feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.</p>

    <p>"Gracious! Queequeg, don't sit there," said I.</p>
