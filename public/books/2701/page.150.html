    <p>Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death is only a launching into the region of
    the strange Untried; it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the Wild, the
    Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of such men, who still have left in them some interior
    compunctions against suicide, does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole
    plain of unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics,
    the thousand mermaids sing to them&mdash;"Come hither, broken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of
    intermediate death; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them. Come hither! bury thyself in a life
    which, to your now equally abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than death. Come hither! put up
    THY gravestone, too, within the churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!"</p>

    <p>Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by fall of eve, the blacksmith's soul responded,
    Aye, I come! And so Perth went a-whaling.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 113. The Forge.</h2>
    <p>With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about mid-day, Perth was standing between his
    forge and anvil, the latter placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the coals, and with
    the other at his forge's lungs, when Captain Ahab came along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern
    bag. While yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from
    the fire, began hammering it upon the anvil&mdash;the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights,
    some of which flew close to Ahab.</p>

    <p>"Are these thy Mother Carey's chickens, Perth? they are always flying in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but
    not to all;&mdash;look here, they burn; but thou&mdash;thou liv'st among them without a scorch."</p>

    <p>"Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab," answered Perth, resting for a moment on his hammer; "I am past
    scorching; not easily can'st thou scorch a scar."</p>

    <p>"Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful to me. In no Paradise myself, I am
    impatient of all misery in others that is not mad. Thou should'st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou not go mad?
    How can'st thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens yet hate thee, that thou can'st not go mad?&mdash;What wert
    thou making there?"</p>

    <p>"Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it."</p>

    <p>"And can'st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard usage as it had?"</p>

    <p>"I think so, sir."</p>

    <p>"And I suppose thou can'st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?"</p>

    <p>"Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one."</p>

    <p>"Look ye here, then," cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning with both hands on Perth's shoulders; "look
    ye here&mdash;HERE&mdash;can ye smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith," sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow;
    "if thou could'st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between
    my eyes. Answer! Can'st thou smoothe this seam?"</p>

    <p>"Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?"</p>

    <p>"Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for though thou only see'st it here in my flesh,
    it has worked down into the bone of my skull&mdash;THAT is all wrinkles! But, away with child's play; no more gaffs
    and pikes to-day. Look ye here!" jingling the leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. "I, too, want a
    harpoon made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something that will stick in a whale like
    his own fin-bone. There's the stuff," flinging the pouch upon the anvil. "Look ye, blacksmith, these are the
    gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses."</p>

    <p>"Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths
    ever work."</p>

    <p>"I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge
    me the harpoon. And forge me first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these twelve
    together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I'll blow the fire."</p>

    <p>When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by spiralling them, with his own hand, round
    a long, heavy iron bolt. "A flaw!" rejecting the last one. "Work that over again, Perth."</p>

    <p>This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would
    weld his own iron. As, then, with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to him the glowing
    rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed
    silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil. But,
    as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.</p>

    <p>"What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?" muttered Stubb, looking on from the forecastle. "That
    Parsee smells fire like a fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's powder-pan."</p>

    <p>At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as Perth, to temper it, plunged it all
    hissing into the cask of water near by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face.</p>

    <p>"Would'st thou brand me, Perth?" wincing for a moment with the pain; "have I been but forging my own
    branding-iron, then?"</p>

    <p>"Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this harpoon for the White Whale?"</p>

    <p>"For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them thyself, man. Here are my razors&mdash;the best
    of steel; here, and make the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea."</p>

    <p>For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them.</p>

    <p>"Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup, nor pray till&mdash;but here&mdash;to
    work!"</p>

    <p>Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the
    iron; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he cried to Ahab
    to place the water-cask near.</p>

    <p>"No, no&mdash;no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy, there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo!
    What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb?" holding it high up. A cluster of dark
    nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale's barbs were then
    tempered.</p>
