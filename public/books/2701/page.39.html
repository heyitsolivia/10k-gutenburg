    <p>So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were set, and the band on deck sentinelled the
    slumbers of the band below; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it not rudely
    down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates;
    when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the
    cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way. Some
    considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these, he usually abstained from patrolling the
    quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would have been
    the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of
    sharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was
    measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a certain
    unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could
    say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a
    globe of tow, and the insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab then.</p>

    <p>"Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb," said Ahab, "that thou wouldst wad me that fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot.
    Below to thy nightly grave; where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at
    last.&mdash;Down, dog, and kennel!"</p>

    <p>Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a
    moment; then said excitedly, "I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like it,
    sir."</p>

    <p>"Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away, as if to avoid some passionate
    temptation.</p>

    <p>"No, sir; not yet," said Stubb, emboldened, "I will not tamely be called a dog, sir."</p>

    <p>"Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone, or I'll clear the world of thee!"</p>

    <p>As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily
    retreated.</p>

    <p>"I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it," muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending
    the cabin-scuttle. "It's very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don't well know whether to go back and strike him,
    or&mdash;what's that?&mdash;down here on my knees and pray for him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but
    it would be the first time I ever DID pray. It's queer; very queer; and he's queer too; aye, take him fore and aft,
    he's about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!&mdash;his eyes like powder-pans! is he
    mad? Anyway there's something on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks. He aint in
    his bed now, either, more than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don't sleep then. Didn't that Dough-Boy,
    the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man's hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and
    the sheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as
    though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I guess he's got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it's
    a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say&mdash;worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don't know what it is, but the Lord keep
    me from catching it. He's full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy
    tells me he suspects; what's that for, I should like to know? Who's made appointments with him in the hold? Ain't
    that queer, now? But there's no telling, it's the old game&mdash;Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it's worth a
    fellow's while to be born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think of it, that's about the
    first thing babies do, and that's a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of 'em. But
    that's against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth&mdash;So
    here goes again. But how's that? didn't he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot
    of jackasses on top of THAT! He might as well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he DID kick me, and I didn't
    observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil's the
    matter with me? I don't stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out.
    By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though&mdash;How? how? how?&mdash;but the only way's to stash it; so here
    goes to hammock again; and in the morning, I'll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight."</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 30. The Pipe.</h2>
    <p>When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him
    of late, calling a sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting the pipe
    at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.</p>

    <p>In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of
    the narwhale. How could one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him of the royalty
    it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.</p>

    <p>Some moments passed, during which the thick vapour came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs, which blew
    back again into his face. "How now," he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, "this smoking no longer soothes.
    Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not
    pleasuring&mdash;aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with such nervous whiffs,
    as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this
    pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs, not among torn
    iron-grey locks like mine. I'll smoke no more&mdash;"</p>

    <p>He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the waves; the same instant the ship shot by
    the bubble the sinking pipe made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.</p>
