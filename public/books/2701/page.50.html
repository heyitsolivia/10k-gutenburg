    <p>There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from
    the sea; by the sea, from the inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move your foot or
    hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And
    perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air
    into the summer sea, no more to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.</h2>
    <p>(ENTER AHAB: THEN, ALL)</p>

    <p>It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his
    wont, ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country
    gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the garden.</p>

    <p>Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his
    tread, that they were all over dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did you fixedly
    gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also, you would see still stranger foot-prints&mdash;the
    foot-prints of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.</p>

    <p>But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper
    mark. And, so full of his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at
    the binnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely
    possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement.</p>

    <p>"D'ye mark him, Flask?" whispered Stubb; "the chick that's in him pecks the shell. 'Twill soon be out."</p>

    <p>The hours wore on;&mdash;Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the deck, with the same intense bigotry
    of purpose in his aspect.</p>

    <p>It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the
    auger-hole there, and with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.</p>

    <p>"Sir!" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship-board except in some extraordinary
    case.</p>

    <p>"Send everybody aft," repeated Ahab. "Mast-heads, there! come down!"</p>

    <p>When the entire ship's company were assembled, and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing
    him, for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing over the
    bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh
    him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of
    the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have summoned them
    there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat. But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he
    cried:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?"</p>

    <p>"Sing out for him!" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices.</p>

    <p>"Good!" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected
    question had so magnetically thrown them.</p>

    <p>"And what do ye next, men?"</p>

    <p>"Lower away, and after him!"</p>

    <p>"And what tune is it ye pull to, men?"</p>

    <p>"A dead whale or a stove boat!"</p>

    <p>More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the countenance of the old man at every shout;
    while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so
    excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.</p>

    <p>But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up
    a shroud, and tightly, almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale. Look ye! d'ye see this Spanish
    ounce of gold?"&mdash;holding up a broad bright coin to the sun&mdash;"it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D'ye see
    it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul."</p>

    <p>While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the
    skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to
    himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels
    of his vitality in him.</p>

    <p>Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand,
    exhibiting the gold with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: "Whosoever of ye raises me a
    white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with
    three holes punctured in his starboard fluke&mdash;look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he
    shall have this gold ounce, my boys!"</p>

    <p>"Huzza! huzza!" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the
    mast.</p>

    <p>"It's a white whale, I say," resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul: "a white whale. Skin your eyes for him,
    men; look sharp for white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out."</p>

    <p>All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the
    rest, and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by
    some specific recollection.</p>

    <p>"Captain Ahab," said Tashtego, "that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick."</p>

    <p>"Moby Dick?" shouted Ahab. "Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?"</p>

    <p>"Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?" said the Gay-Header deliberately.</p>

    <p>"And has he a curious spout, too," said Daggoo, "very bushy, even for a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain
    Ahab?"</p>

    <p>"And he have one, two, three&mdash;oh! good many iron in him hide, too, Captain," cried Queequeg disjointedly,
    "all twiske-tee be-twisk, like him&mdash;him&mdash;" faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and
    round as though uncorking a bottle&mdash;"like him&mdash;him&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Corkscrew!" cried Ahab, "aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout
    is a big one, like a whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual
    sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick
    ye have seen&mdash;Moby Dick&mdash;Moby Dick!"</p>
