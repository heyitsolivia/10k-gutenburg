    <p>As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it
    had sunk, with a wild voice exclaimed&mdash;"Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than to have seen
    thee, thou white ghost!"</p>

    <p>"What was it, Sir?" said Flask.</p>

    <p>"The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld, and returned to their ports to tell of
    it."</p>

    <p>But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel; the rest as silently following.</p>

    <p>Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object, certain it is,
    that a glimpse of it being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness. So
    rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet
    very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form; notwithstanding, they
    believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food. For though other species of whales find their food above
    water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones
    below the surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that food consists. At
    times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some of them
    thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged
    ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with
    teeth in order to attack and tear it.</p>

    <p>There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into
    Squid. The manner in which the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some other particulars
    he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he
    assigns it.</p>

    <p>By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature, here spoken of, it is included
    among the class of cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would seem to belong, but only as
    the Anak of the tribe.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 60. The Line.</h2>
    <p>With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as for the better understanding of all
    similar scenes elsewhere presented, I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.</p>

    <p>The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with
    it, as in the case of ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to the
    rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would
    the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected; but as
    most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no means adds to the rope's durability or strength, however
    much it may give it compactness and gloss.</p>

    <p>Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for
    whale-lines; for, though not so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add
    (since there is an aesthetics in all things), is much more handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a
    dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.</p>

    <p>The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight, you would not think it so strong as it
    really is. By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so
    that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures
    something over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like
    the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded "sheaves," or
    layers of concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the "heart," or minute vertical tube formed at the axis
    of the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody's arm,
    leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume
    almost an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a
    block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.</p>

    <p>In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs.
    There is some advantage in this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do
    not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a
    rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat
    is like critical ice, which will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated one.
    When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a
    prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.</p>

    <p>Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom
    against the side of the tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything. This arrangement of
    the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line
    from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line
    originally attached to the harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it
    were, from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second:
    This arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached
    to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking minute as he
    sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the
    profundity of the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.</p>
