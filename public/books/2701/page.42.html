    <p>BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER I. (SPERM WHALE).&mdash;This whale, among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa
    whale, and the Physeter whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich
    of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;
    the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in
    commerce; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his
    peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do.
    Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his
    own proper individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days
    spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in
    England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor
    of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti
    was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from
    the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of
    spermaceti became known, its original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a
    notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon
    the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived.</p>

    <p>BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER II. (RIGHT WHALE).&mdash;In one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans,
    being the one first regularly hunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and the
    oil specially known as "whale oil," an inferior article in commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately
    designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True
    Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously
    baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of
    the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen;
    the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the
    Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian
    ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor' West Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right
    Whale Cruising Grounds.</p>

    <p>Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans.
    But they precisely agree in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact
    upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive
    differences, that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The right whale will be
    elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.</p>

    <p>BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER III. (FIN-BACK).&mdash;Under this head I reckon a monster which, by the various names of
    Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet
    is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains,
    and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter colour,
    approaching to olive. His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of
    large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous
    object. This fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of an angular
    shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this
    isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and
    slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled
    surface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and
    wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems
    a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in
    the remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a
    barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man;
    this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back.
    From having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic
    species denominated WHALEBONE WHALES, that is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would
    seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales;
    pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen's names for a few
    sorts.</p>

    <p>In connection with this appellative of "Whalebone whales," it is of great importance to mention, that however
    such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt
    a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding
    that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of
    Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The baleen,
    hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of
    whales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars.
    Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same
    humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is
    just the same with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular
    combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all
    general methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.</p>
