    <p>But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and
    the ship, the Jeroboam's boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod, as she
    heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed,
    at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some way ahead; but would be soon
    skilfully brought to her proper bearings again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now and then, a
    conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a
    very different sort.</p>

    <p>Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam's boat, was a man of a singular appearance, even in that wild whaling life where
    individual notabilities make up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled all over his face
    with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge
    enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was
    in his eyes.</p>

    <p>So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had exclaimed&mdash;"That's he! that's he!&mdash;the
    long-togged scaramouch the Town-Ho's company told us of!" Stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the
    Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this
    account and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful
    ascendency over almost everybody in the Jeroboam. His story was this:</p>

    <p>He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna Shakers, where he had been a great prophet;
    in their cracked, secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trap-door, announcing
    the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing
    gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having seized him, he had left
    Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady, common-sense exterior,
    and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam's whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway
    upon the ship's getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in a freshet. He announced himself as the
    archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he set himself
    forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with
    which he declared these things;&mdash;the dark, daring play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the
    preternatural terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant
    crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they were afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much
    practical use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous captain would
    fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that individual's intention was to land him in the first convenient
    port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials&mdash;devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional
    perdition, in case this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew, that
    at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of them would
    remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say
    or do what he would; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of
    all this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had
    broken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole command;
    nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of
    them fawned before him; in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god. Such
    things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in
    respect to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless power of deceiving and
    bedevilling so many others. But it is time to return to the Pequod.</p>

    <p>"I fear not thy epidemic, man," said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain Mayhew, who stood in the boat's stern;
    "come on board."</p>

    <p>But now Gabriel started to his feet.</p>

    <p>"Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible plague!"</p>

    <p>"Gabriel! Gabriel!" cried Captain Mayhew; "thou must either&mdash;" But that instant a headlong wave shot the
    boat far ahead, and its seethings drowned all speech.</p>

    <p>"Hast thou seen the White Whale?" demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted back.</p>

    <p>"Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the horrible tail!"</p>

    <p>"I tell thee again, Gabriel, that&mdash;" But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends. Nothing was said
    for some moments, while a succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional caprices of the
    seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale's head jogged about very violently, and
    Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant.</p>

    <p>When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without
    frequent interruptions from Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with
    him.</p>

    <p>It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably
    apprised of the existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence, Gabriel
    solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering
    insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving
    the Bible. But when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the chief
    mate, burned with ardour to encounter him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the
    opportunity, despite all the archangel's denunciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to
    man his boat. With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at
    last succeeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one
    arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity.
    Now, while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat's bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was
    venting his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad
    white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the
    oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a
    long arc in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was harmed,
    nor a hair of any oarsman's head; but the mate for ever sank.</p>
