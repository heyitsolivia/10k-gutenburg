    <p>"Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir."</p>

    <p>"Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the unconquerable captain in the soul should
    have such a craven mate!"</p>

    <p>"Sir?"</p>

    <p>"My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane&mdash;there, that shivered lance will do. Muster the men.
    Surely I have not seen him yet. By heaven it cannot be!&mdash;missing?&mdash;quick! call them all."</p>

    <p>The old man's hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the Parsee was not there.</p>

    <p>"The Parsee!" cried Stubb&mdash;"he must have been caught in&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"The black vomit wrench thee!&mdash;run all of ye above, alow, cabin, forecastle&mdash;find him&mdash;not
    gone&mdash;not gone!"</p>

    <p>But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was nowhere to be found.</p>

    <p>"Aye, sir," said Stubb&mdash;"caught among the tangles of your line&mdash;I thought I saw him dragging
    under."</p>

    <p>"MY line! MY line? Gone?&mdash;gone? What means that little word?&mdash;What death-knell rings in it, that old
    Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry. The harpoon, too!&mdash;toss over the litter there,&mdash;d'ye see
    it?&mdash;the forged iron, men, the white whale's&mdash;no, no, no,&mdash;blistered fool! this hand did dart
    it!&mdash;'tis in the fish!&mdash;Aloft there! Keep him nailed&mdash;Quick!&mdash;all hands to the rigging of the
    boats&mdash;collect the oars&mdash;harpooneers! the irons, the irons!&mdash;hoist the royals higher&mdash;a pull on
    all the sheets!&mdash;helm there! steady, steady for your life! I'll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and
    dive straight through it, but I'll slay him yet!</p>

    <p>"Great God! but for one single instant show thyself," cried Starbuck; "never, never wilt thou capture him, old
    man&mdash;In Jesus' name no more of this, that's worse than devil's madness. Two days chased; twice stove to
    splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil shadow gone&mdash;all good angels mobbing thee
    with warnings:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"What more wouldst thou have?&mdash;Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man? Shall
    we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,&mdash;Impiety
    and blasphemy to hunt him more!"</p>

    <p>"Starbuck, of late I've felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that hour we both saw&mdash;thou know'st what,
    in one another's eyes. But in this matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
    hand&mdash;a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This whole act's immutably decreed. 'Twas
    rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates' lieutenant; I act under
    orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.&mdash;Stand round me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the
    stump; leaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. 'Tis Ahab&mdash;his body's part; but Ahab's soul's
    a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in
    a gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye'll hear me crack; and till ye hear THAT, know that Ahab's hawser tows
    his purpose yet. Believe ye, men, in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they drown,
    drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick&mdash;two
    days he's floated&mdash;tomorrow will be the third. Aye, men, he'll rise once more,&mdash;but only to spout his
    last! D'ye feel brave men, brave?"</p>

    <p>"As fearless fire," cried Stubb.</p>

    <p>"And as mechanical," muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he muttered on: "The things called omens! And
    yesterday I talked the same to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek to drive out of
    others' hearts what's clinched so fast in mine!&mdash;The Parsee&mdash;the Parsee!&mdash;gone, gone? and he was to
    go before:&mdash;but still was to be seen again ere I could perish&mdash;How's that?&mdash;There's a riddle now
    might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of judges:&mdash;like a hawk's beak it pecks my
    brain. I'LL, I'LL solve it, though!"</p>

    <p>When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.</p>

    <p>So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on the previous night; only, the sound of
    hammers, and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete
    and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken
    keel of Ahab's wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still as on the night before, slouched Ahab
    stood fixed within his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat due
    eastward for the earliest sun.</p>

    <p>The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head
    was relieved by crowds of the daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.</p>

    <p>"D'ye see him?" cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.</p>
