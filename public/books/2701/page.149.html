    <p>There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some
    hidden soul beneath; like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St. John. And meet
    it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters' Fields of all four continents, the
    waves should rise and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades and shadows, drowned
    dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like
    slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.</p>

    <p>To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must ever after be the sea of his adoption. It
    rolls the midmost waters of the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same waves wash the
    moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but
    still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles, and
    low-lying, endless, unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious, divine Pacific zones the
    world's whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those
    eternal swells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.</p>

    <p>But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab's brain, as standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the
    mizen rigging, with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles (in whose sweet woods
    mild lovers must be walking), and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea
    in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at length upon these almost final waters, and
    gliding towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the old man's purpose intensified itself. His firm lips met like the
    lips of a vice; the Delta of his forehead's veins swelled like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry
    ran through the vaulted hull, "Stern all! the White Whale spouts thick blood!"</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 112. The Blacksmith.</h2>
    <p>Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in these latitudes, and in preparation for the
    peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old blacksmith, had not removed
    his portable forge to the hold again, after concluding his contributory work for Ahab's leg, but still retained it
    on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and
    harpooneers, and bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their various
    weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding
    boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement, as he toiled.
    Nevertheless, this old man's was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance
    did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken back, he toiled away,
    as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it
    was.&mdash;Most miserable!</p>

    <p>A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early
    period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted questionings
    he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched
    fate.</p>

    <p>Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter's midnight, on the road running between two country towns, the
    blacksmith half-stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning, dilapidated
    barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both feet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came
    out the four acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life's
    drama.</p>

    <p>He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow's technicals
    called ruin. He had been an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house and garden; embraced a
    youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking
    church, planted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning
    disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to
    tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family's heart. It was the Bottle
    Conjuror! Upon the opening of that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now, for prudent,
    most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith's shop was in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate
    entrance to it; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with
    vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed old husband's hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by
    passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor's iron
    lullaby, the blacksmith's infants were rocked to slumber.</p>

    <p>Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to
    thyself ere his full ruin came upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly
    venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of them a care-killing competency. But Death
    plucked down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some
    other family, and left the worse than useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him easier
    to harvest.</p>

    <p>Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between; and each blow every
    day grew fainter than the last; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing into the
    weeping faces of her children; the bellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother
    dived down into the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed her thither; and the houseless, familyless
    old man staggered off a vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls!</p>
