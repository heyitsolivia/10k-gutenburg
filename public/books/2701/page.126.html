    <p>"The WHITE Whale&mdash;a Sperm Whale&mdash;Moby Dick, have ye seen him?</p>

    <p>"Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale&mdash;no."</p>

    <p>"Very good, then; good bye now, and I'll call again in a minute."</p>

    <p>Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his
    report, he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted&mdash;"No, Sir! No!" Upon which Ahab retired, and Stubb
    returned to the Frenchman.</p>

    <p>He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had
    slung his nose in a sort of bag.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter with your nose, there?" said Stubb. "Broke it?"</p>

    <p>"I wish it was broken, or that I didn't have any nose at all!" answered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to
    relish the job he was at very much. "But what are you holding YOURS for?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, nothing! It's a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain't it? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw
    us a bunch of posies, will ye, Bouton-de-Rose?"</p>

    <p>"What in the devil's name do you want here?" roared the Guernseyman, flying into a sudden passion.</p>

    <p>"Oh! keep cool&mdash;cool? yes, that's the word! why don't you pack those whales in ice while you're working at
    'em? But joking aside, though; do you know, Rose-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such
    whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a gill in his whole carcase."</p>

    <p>"I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a
    Cologne manufacturer before. But come aboard, and mayhap he'll believe you, if he won't me; and so I'll get out of
    this dirty scrape."</p>

    <p>"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow," rejoined Stubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck.
    There a queer scene presented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles
    in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good
    humor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would
    drop their work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the plague,
    dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes
    almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their
    olfactories.</p>

    <p>Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the Captain's round-house abaft; and
    looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within. This was
    the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to
    the Captain's round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could not help yelling out his
    entreaties and indignations at times.</p>

    <p>Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him,
    during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who had brought
    them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the
    Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore held his peace on that head, but
    otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both
    circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to
    this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter's office, was to tell the Captain what
    he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in
    him during the interview.</p>

    <p>By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a small and dark, but rather delicate looking
    man for a sea-captain, with large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with
    watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once
    ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them.</p>

    <p>"What shall I say to him first?" said he.</p>

    <p>"Why," said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, "you may as well begin by telling him that he
    looks a sort of babyish to me, though I don't pretend to be a judge."</p>

    <p>"He says, Monsieur," said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his captain, "that only yesterday his ship
    spoke a vessel, whose captain and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale
    they had brought alongside."</p>

    <p>Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.</p>

    <p>"What now?" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.</p>

    <p>"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more
    fit to command a whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he's a baboon."</p>

    <p>"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is far more deadly than the blasted one; in
    fine, Monsieur, he conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish."</p>

    <p>Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the
    cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.</p>

    <p>"What now?" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to them.</p>

    <p>"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that&mdash;that&mdash;in fact, tell him I've diddled him, and
    (aside to himself) perhaps somebody else."</p>

    <p>"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service to us."</p>

    <p>Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties (meaning himself and mate) and concluded by
    inviting Stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.</p>

    <p>"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him," said the interpreter.</p>

    <p>"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink with the man I've diddled. In fact, tell
    him I must go."</p>

    <p>"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking; but that if Monsieur wants to live another
    day to drink, then Monsieur had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for it's so calm
    they won't drift."</p>

    <p>By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed the Guernsey-man to this
    effect,&mdash;that having a long tow-line in his boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the
    lighter whale of the two from the ship's side. While the Frenchman's boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship
    one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long
    tow-line.</p>
