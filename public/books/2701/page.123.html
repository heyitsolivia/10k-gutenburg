    <p>The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a mob of young collegians, they are full of
    fight, fun, and wickedness, tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no prudent
    underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this
    turbulence though, and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about in quest of settlements,
    that is, harems.</p>

    <p>Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes. Say
    you strike a Forty-barrel-bull&mdash;poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a member of the harem school,
    and her companions swim around her with every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as
    themselves to fall a prey.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.</h2>
    <p>The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one, necessitates some account of the laws and
    regulations of the whale fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.</p>

    <p>It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company, a whale may be struck by one vessel, then
    escape, and be finally killed and captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor
    contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For example,&mdash;after a weary and perilous chase and
    capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to
    leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus
    the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen, were there not some written or
    unwritten, universal, undisputed law applicable to all cases.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by
    the States-General in A.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet the American
    fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse
    comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian's Pandects and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of
    Meddling with other People's Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne's farthing, or the barb of
    a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.</p>

    <p>I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.</p>

    <p>II. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.</p>

    <p>But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it, which necessitates a vast
    volume of commentaries to expound it.</p>

    <p>First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast, when it is connected with an occupied ship
    or boat, by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupants,&mdash;a mast, an oar, a nine-inch cable, a
    telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the same. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif,
    or any other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any
    time to take it alongside, as well as their intention so to do.</p>

    <p>These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard
    words and harder knocks&mdash;the Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and honourable
    whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one
    party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But others are by no means so
    scrupulous.</p>

    <p>Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in England, wherein the plaintiffs set
    forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had succeeded
    in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines,
    but their boat itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up with the whale, struck, killed,
    seized, and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were
    remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs' teeth, and assured them that by way of
    doxology to the deed he had done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had remained attached to
    the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their
    whale, line, harpoons, and boat.</p>

    <p>Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the judge. In the course of the defence, the
    witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein a gentleman,
    after in vain trying to bridle his wife's viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in the
    course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to recover possession of her. Erskine was on the
    other side; and he then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady, and had
    once had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her;
    yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her,
    the lady then became that subsequent gentleman's property, along with whatever harpoon might have been found
    sticking in her.</p>

    <p>Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally
    illustrative of each other.</p>

    <p>These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very learned Judge in set terms decided, to
    wit,&mdash;That as for the boat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save their
    lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the
    whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish
    made off with them, it (the fish) acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the
    fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took the fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were
    theirs.</p>

    <p>A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might possibly object to it. But ploughed up to
    the primary rock of the matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted, and
    applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and
    Loose-Fish, I say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence; for notwithstanding
    its complicated tracery of sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines, has but two props
    to stand on.</p>
