    <p>"Line! line!" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; "him fast! him fast!&mdash;Who line him! Who
    struck?&mdash;Two whale; one big, one little!"</p>

    <p>"What ails ye, man?" cried Starbuck.</p>

    <p>"Look-e here," said Queequeg, pointing down.</p>

    <p>As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope; as, after deep
    sounding, he floats up again, and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air;
    so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still
    tethered to its dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with the maternal end
    loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of
    the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*</p>

    <p>*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at
    all seasons; after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a time; though in
    some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob:&mdash;a contingency provided for in suckling by two
    teats, curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that. When
    by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the mother's pouring milk and blood
    rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well
    with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute MORE HOMINUM.</p>

    <p>And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights, did these inscrutable
    creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled in
    dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being, do I myself still for ever centrally
    disport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and deep inland there
    I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the
    activity of the other boats, still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or possibly carrying
    on the war within the first circle, where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the
    sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles, was nothing to what
    at last met our eyes. It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert, to seek
    to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a
    short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we
    afterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying along
    with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing among the
    revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he
    went.</p>

    <p>But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror
    with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance
    obscured from us. But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale
    had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and
    while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line
    round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now
    churning through the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him,
    wounding and murdering his own comrades.</p>

    <p>This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright. First, the whales forming the
    margin of our lake began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows from
    afar; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;
    in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters.
    Yes, the long calm was departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the tumultuous masses of
    block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner
    centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck
    taking the stern.</p>

    <p>"Oars! Oars!" he intensely whispered, seizing the helm&mdash;"gripe your oars, and clutch your souls, now! My
    God, men, stand by! Shove him off, you Queequeg&mdash;the whale there!&mdash;prick him!&mdash;hit him! Stand
    up&mdash;stand up, and stay so! Spring, men&mdash;pull, men; never mind their backs&mdash;scrape them!&mdash;scrape
    away!"</p>

    <p>The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long
    lengths. But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly, and at the
    same time earnestly watching for another outlet. After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided
    into what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales, all violently making for one
    centre. This lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg's hat, who, while standing in the bows to
    prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a
    pair of broad flukes close by.</p>

    <p>Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic
    movement; for having clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their onward flight with
    augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged
    whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned
    pole, two or three of which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at hand, are inserted
    upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior
    possession, should the boats of any other ship draw near.</p>
