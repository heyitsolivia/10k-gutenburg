    <p>"'Nay,' said Don Sebastian; 'but I know a worthy priest near by, who will quickly procure one for me. I go for
    it; but are you well advised? this may grow too serious.'</p>

    <p>"'Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?'</p>

    <p>"'Though there are no Auto-da-Fe's in Lima now,' said one of the company to another; 'I fear our sailor friend
    runs risk of the archiepiscopacy. Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.'</p>

    <p>"'Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the
    largest sized Evangelists you can.'</p>

    <p>"'This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,' said Don Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and
    solemn figure.</p>

    <p>"'Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the light, and hold the Holy Book before me that I
    may touch it.</p>

    <p>"'So help me Heaven, and on my honour the story I have told ye, gentlemen, is in substance and its great items,
    true. I know it to be true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I have seen and talked with
    Steelkilt since the death of Radney.'"</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 55. Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.</h2>
    <p>I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas, something like the true form of the whale as he
    actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the
    whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there. It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to
    those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the
    landsman. It is time to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong.</p>

    <p>It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest Hindoo,
    Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble
    panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn
    in scales of chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St. George's; ever since then has something of the
    same sort of license prevailed, not only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific presentations
    of him.</p>

    <p>Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whale's, is to be found in the
    famous cavern-pagoda of Elephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that
    immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any
    of them actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been
    there shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the
    incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is
    half man and half whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong. It
    looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale's majestic flukes.</p>

    <p>But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian painter's portrait of this fish; for he succeeds
    no better than the antediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea-monster or
    whale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the same
    scene in his own "Perseus Descending," make out one whit better. The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster
    undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended
    tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors' Gate leading from the Thames by
    water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah's whale, as depicted in
    the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for the book-binder's whale
    winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor&mdash;as stamped and gilded on the backs and
    title-pages of many books both old and new&mdash;that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated,
    I take it, from the like figures on antique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call
    this book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended when the device was first introduced. It
    was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the Revival of Learning; and in
    those days, and even down to a comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the
    Leviathan.</p>

    <p>In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches
    at the whale, where all manner of spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come bubbling
    up from his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the original edition of the "Advancement of Learning" you will
    find some curious whales.</p>

    <p>But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be
    sober, scientific delineations, by those who know. In old Harris's collection of voyages there are some plates of
    whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled "A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship
    Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master." In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of
    logs, are represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In another plate, the
    prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes.</p>

    <p>Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy,
    entitled "A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale
    Fisheries." In this book is an outline purporting to be a "Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale
    from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck." I doubt not the captain had this
    veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say that it has an
    eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that
    whale a bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that
    eye!</p>
