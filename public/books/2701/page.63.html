    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.</h2>
    <p>So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as indirectly touching one or two very
    interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part, is as
    important a one as will be found in this volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more
    familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood, and moreover to take away any incredulity which a
    profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity of the main points of
    this affair.</p>

    <p>I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be content to produce the desired impression
    by separate citations of items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these citations, I take
    it&mdash;the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself.</p>

    <p>First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete
    escape; and, after an interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain;
    when the two irons, both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where
    three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may have been something more than
    that; the man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore
    there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two
    years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident
    to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels;
    no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no
    purpose. This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known
    three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw
    the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year
    instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly recognised
    a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say three
    years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three instances, then, which I personally know the truth
    of; but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to
    impeach.</p>

    <p>Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there
    have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and
    places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his
    bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may
    be, they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil.
    No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of
    perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were content to
    recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without
    seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible
    great man, they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the acquaintance
    further, they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.</p>

    <p>But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebrity&mdash;Nay, you may call it an
    ocean-wide renown; not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death, but he was
    admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or
    Caesar. Was it not so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long did'st lurk in the
    Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand
    Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O
    Morquan! King of Japan, whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against the
    sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the
    back! In plain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to
    the classic scholar.</p>

    <p>But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various times creating great havoc among the boats
    of different vessels, were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed by valiant whaling
    captains, who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view, as in setting out through the
    Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the
    headmost warrior of the Indian King Philip.</p>

    <p>I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make mention of one or two other things, which
    to me seem important, as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the
    White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires
    full as much bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of
    the world, that without some hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the fishery, they might
    scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable
    allegory.</p>

    <p>First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery, yet they have
    nothing like a fixed, vivid conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur. One reason perhaps
    is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public
    record at home, however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose that that poor fellow there,
    who this moment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the bottom of
    the sea by the sounding leviathan&mdash;do you suppose that that poor fellow's name will appear in the newspaper
    obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New
    Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell
    you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many others we spoke thirty different ships,
    every one of which had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat's
    crew. For God's sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of
    man's blood was spilled for it.</p>
