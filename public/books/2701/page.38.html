    <p>There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the recovery from any. He looked like a man cut
    away from the stake, when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or taking away one
    particle from their compacted aged robustness. His whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped
    in an unalterable mould, like Cellini's cast Perseus. Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and
    continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a
    slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty
    trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig, peels
    and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive,
    but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one
    could certainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it, especially
    by the mates. But once Tashtego's senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not
    till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the fury of any
    mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey
    Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this laid
    eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old
    Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said
    that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out&mdash;which might hardly come to pass, so he
    muttered&mdash;then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to
    sole.</p>

    <p>So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid brand which streaked it, that for the
    first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg
    upon which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the
    polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw. "Aye, he was dismasted off Japan," said the old Gay-Head Indian once; "but
    like his dismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of 'em."</p>

    <p>I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty
    close to the mizzen shrouds, there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His bone leg
    steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out
    beyond the ship's ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable
    wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his officers
    say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not
    painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before
    them with a crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.</p>

    <p>Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But after that morning, he was every day
    visible to the crew; either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily walking the
    deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse;
    as if, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so
    secluded. And, by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet, for all that he
    said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod
    was only making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates
    were fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and
    thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all
    clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed
    gradually to charm him from his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to the
    wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some
    few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful
    allurings of that girlish air. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any other man,
    would have soon flowered out in a smile.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.</h2>
    <p>Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring,
    which, at sea, almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly cool,
    clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped
    up&mdash;flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets,
    nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns! For sleeping
    man, 'twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that
    unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the
    soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most
    forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab's texture.</p>

    <p>Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has to do with aught that looks like
    death. Among sea-commanders, the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked deck. It
    was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits
    were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. "It feels like going down into one's tomb,"&mdash;he
    would mutter to himself&mdash;"for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my
    grave-dug berth."</p>
