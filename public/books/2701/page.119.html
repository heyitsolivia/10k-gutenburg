    <p>Seen from the Pequod's deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of the sea, this host of vapoury spouts,
    individually curling up into the air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the
    thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a
    height.</p>

    <p>As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains, accelerate their march, all eagerness to
    place that perilous passage in their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain; even so did
    this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their
    semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.</p>

    <p>Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from
    the heads of their yet suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through these
    Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of
    their number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be
    swimming, like the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with stun-sail piled on
    stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard,
    loudly directing attention to something in our wake.</p>

    <p>Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear. It seemed formed of detached white
    vapours, rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and go;
    for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved
    in his pivot-hole, crying, "Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails;&mdash;Malays, sir, and after
    us!"</p>

    <p>As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should fairly have entered the straits, these
    rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift Pequod, with
    a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding
    her on to her own chosen pursuit,&mdash;mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they were. As with glass under
    arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the
    bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the above seemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls
    of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to
    his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly
    end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally
    cheering him on with their curses;&mdash;when all these conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's brow was left
    gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag
    the firm thing from its place.</p>

    <p>But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when, after steadily dropping and dropping
    the pirates astern, the Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging at last
    upon the broad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining
    upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the
    wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now
    dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct
    of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three keels that were after them,&mdash;though as yet a mile in their
    rear,&mdash;than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that their spouts all looked like
    flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.</p>

    <p>Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after several hours' pulling were almost
    disposed to renounce the chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they
    were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen
    perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto
    rapidly and steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus' elephants in the
    Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast
    irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed
    their distraction of panic. This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely
    paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been
    but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced
    such excessive dismay. But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though
    banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary horseman.
    Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the
    slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly
    dashing each other to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us, for
    there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.</p>

    <p>Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet it is to be observed that as a whole the
    herd neither advanced nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in those cases, the
    boats at once separated, each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes'
    time, Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with
    us like light, steered straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck
    under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet
    does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and
    deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.</p>
