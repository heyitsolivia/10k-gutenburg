    <p>"Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance favoured, he did not at all fear that his
    ship would founder by the way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at them, those
    six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth,
    well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly
    arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the brutal
    overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and
    desperado from Buffalo.</p>

    <p>"'Lakeman!&mdash;Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?' said Don Sebastian, rising in his
    swinging mat of grass.</p>

    <p>"On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but&mdash;I crave your courtesy&mdash;may be, you shall soon hear
    further of all that. Now, gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as large and stout as
    any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America,
    had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean. For in
    their interflowing aggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours,&mdash;Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and
    Superior, and Michigan,&mdash;possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many of the ocean's noblest traits; with
    many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the
    Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish
    long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks; here and
    there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet
    thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces
    flash from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests, where the
    gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of
    prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of
    Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed
    cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as
    any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have
    drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was
    wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his
    infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he
    had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of
    social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives. Yet was this
    Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed,
    might yet by inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest
    slave's right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved
    so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt&mdash;but, gentlemen, you shall hear.</p>

    <p>"It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven, that the
    Town-Ho's leak seemed again increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must
    know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping
    their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty
    in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on account of all
    hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen,
    is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of
    considerable length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat is
    afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really
    landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.</p>

    <p>"Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found gaining once more, there was in truth
    some small concern manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the upper sails
    to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as
    little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any
    fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he
    betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of
    his being a part owner in her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small
    gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear
    water; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen&mdash;that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck, and poured
    itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.</p>

    <p>"Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours&mdash;watery or otherwise;
    that when a person placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in
    general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if
    he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern's tower, and make a little heap of dust of it. Be
    this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a
    Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy's snorting charger; and a brain,
    and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son to
    Charlemagne's father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not
    love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.</p>
