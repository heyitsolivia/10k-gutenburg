    <p>As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising success; all the more wonderful, for
    that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish.
    Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional
    supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in
    the captain's and officers' state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling-wood; and the
    cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle,
    the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook
    had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and
    filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was
    filled with sperm, except the captain's pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in
    self-complacent testimony of his entire satisfaction.</p>

    <p>As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from
    her forecastle; and drawing still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try-pots, which,
    covered with the parchment-like POKE or stomach skin of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of
    the clenched hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued
    girls who had eloped with them from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly secured
    aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were
    presiding over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship's company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of
    the try-works, from which the huge pots had been removed. You would have almost thought they were pulling down the
    cursed Bastille, such wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the
    sea.</p>

    <p>Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the ship's elevated quarter-deck, so that the
    whole rejoicing drama was full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion.</p>

    <p>And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black, with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships
    crossed each other's wakes&mdash;one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings as to things to
    come&mdash;their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene.</p>

    <p>"Come aboard, come aboard!" cried the gay Bachelor's commander, lifting a glass and a bottle in the air.</p>

    <p>"Hast seen the White Whale?" gritted Ahab in reply.</p>

    <p>"No; only heard of him; but don't believe in him at all," said the other good-humoredly. "Come aboard!"</p>

    <p>"Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?"</p>

    <p>"Not enough to speak of&mdash;two islanders, that's all;&mdash;but come aboard, old hearty, come along. I'll soon
    take that black from your brow. Come along, will ye (merry's the play); a full ship and homeward-bound."</p>

    <p>"How wondrous familiar is a fool!" muttered Ahab; then aloud, "Thou art a full ship and homeward bound, thou
    sayst; well, then, call me an empty ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward there! Set all
    sail, and keep her to the wind!"</p>

    <p>And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other stubbornly fought against it; and so the
    two vessels parted; the crew of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the receding Bachelor; but
    the Bachelor's men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the
    taffrail, eyed the homewardbound craft, he took from his pocket a small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship
    to the vial, seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was filled with Nantucket
    soundings.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale.</h2>
    <p>Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune's favourites sail close by us, we, though all adroop
    before, catch somewhat of the rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed it with the
    Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor, whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by
    Ahab.</p>

    <p>It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done: and floating in the
    lovely sunset sea and sky, sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and such plaintiveness,
    such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green
    convent valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea, freighted
    with these vesper hymns.</p>

    <p>Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned off from the whale, sat intently watching
    his final wanings from the now tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales
    dying&mdash;the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring&mdash;that strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid
    evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.</p>

    <p>"He turns and turns him to it,&mdash;how slowly, but how steadfastly, his homage-rendering and invoking brow,
    with his last dying motions. He too worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!&mdash;Oh that
    these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights. Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of
    human weal or woe; in these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets; where for
    long Chinese ages, the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the Niger's
    unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith; but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the
    corpse, and it heads some other way.</p>

    <p>"Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the
    heart of these unverdured seas; thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the
    wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying
    head, and then gone round again, without a lesson to me.</p>

    <p>"Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring, rainbowed jet!&mdash;that one strivest, this one
    jettest all in vain! In vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening sun, that only calls
    forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou, darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy
    unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of once living things, exhaled as air, but water
    now.</p>
