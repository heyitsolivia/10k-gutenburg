    <p>"He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks. Now I don't like this. I make a leg for
    Captain Ahab, and he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won't put his head into
    it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It's like
    turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I don't like this cobbling sort of
    business&mdash;I don't like it at all; it's undignified; it's not my place. Let tinkers' brats do tinkerings; we are
    their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that
    regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a
    cobbler's job, that's at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end. It's the old woman's tricks to be
    giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who
    ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that's the reason I never would work for lonely widow old women
    ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off
    with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let me see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay
    over the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship's stern. Were ever
    such things done before with a coffin? Some superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere
    they would do the job. But I'm made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don't budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing
    about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as
    coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore
    of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. Hem! I'll do the job, now,
    tenderly. I'll have me&mdash;let's see&mdash;how many in the ship's company, all told? But I've forgotten. Any way,
    I'll have me thirty separate, Turk's-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then,
    if the hull go down, there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often
    beneath the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let's to it."</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 127. The Deck.</h2>
    <p>THE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINE-TUBS, BETWEEN THE VICE-BENCH AND THE OPEN HATCHWAY; THE CARPENTER CAULKING ITS
    SEAMS; THE STRING OF TWISTED OAKUM SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE BOSOM OF HIS
    FROCK.&mdash;AHAB COMES SLOWLY FROM THE CABIN-GANGWAY, AND HEARS PIP FOLLOWING HIM.</p>

    <p>"Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand complies with my humor more genially than
    that boy.&mdash;Middle aisle of a church! What's here?"</p>

    <p>"Life-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck's orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the hatchway!"</p>

    <p>"Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault."</p>

    <p>"Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does."</p>

    <p>"Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?"</p>

    <p>"I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?"</p>

    <p>"Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?"</p>

    <p>"Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but they've set me now to turning it into
    something else."</p>

    <p>"Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling, monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one
    day making legs, and the next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those same coffins? Thou
    art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a jack-of-all-trades."</p>

    <p>"But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do."</p>

    <p>"The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches
    when chipping out the craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in hand. Dost thou
    never?"</p>

    <p>"Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I'm indifferent enough, sir, for that; but the reason why the grave-digger made music
    must have been because there was none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark to it."</p>

    <p>"Aye, and that's because the lid there's a sounding-board; and what in all things makes the sounding-board is
    this&mdash;there's naught beneath. And yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter. Hast
    thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate, going in?</p>

    <p>"Faith, sir, I've&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Faith? What's that?"</p>

    <p>"Why, faith, sir, it's only a sort of exclamation-like&mdash;that's all, sir."</p>

    <p>"Um, um; go on."</p>

    <p>"I was about to say, sir, that&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself? Look at thy bosom! Despatch! and get these
    traps out of sight."</p>

    <p>"He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot latitudes. I've heard that the Isle of
    Albemarle, one of the Gallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me some sort of Equator cuts
    yon old man, too, right in his middle. He's always under the Line&mdash;fiery hot, I tell ye! He's looking this
    way&mdash;come, oakum; quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the cork, and I'm the professor of musical
    glasses&mdash;tap, tap!"</p>

    <p>(AHAB TO HIMSELF.)</p>

    <p>"There's a sight! There's a sound! The grey-headed woodpecker tapping the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well
    be envied now. See! that thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious wag, that fellow.
    Rat-tat! So man's seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all materials! What things real are there, but imponderable
    thoughts? Here now's the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the expressive sign of the help and
    hope of most endangered life. A life-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some spiritual sense
    the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver! I'll think of that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark
    side of earth, that its other side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me. Will ye never have
    done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound? I go below; let me not see that thing here when I return again. Now,
    then, Pip, we'll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee! Some unknown conduits from the
    unknown worlds must empty into thee!"</p>
