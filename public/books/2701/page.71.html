    <p>"Can't you twist that smaller?" said Flask. "Yes, that's the law. I should like to see a boat's crew backing
    water up to a whale face foremost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind that!"</p>

    <p>Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement of the entire case. Considering,
    therefore, that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of common
    occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I
    must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boat&mdash;oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is
    in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that the
    particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Starbuck's driving on to his whale
    almost in the teeth of a squall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great
    heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck's boat; and finally
    considering in what a devil's chase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking all things together, I say, I
    thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will. "Queequeg," said I, "come along, you shall be my
    lawyer, executor, and legatee."</p>

    <p>It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments, but there are
    no people in the world more fond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical life that I had done the
    same thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled
    away from my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after
    his resurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be. I survived myself; my
    death and burial were locked up in my chest. I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a
    clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.</p>

    <p>Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock, here goes for a cool, collected dive at
    death and destruction, and the devil fetch the hindmost.</p>

    <p>"Who would have thought it, Flask!" cried Stubb; "if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat, unless
    maybe to stop the plug-hole with my timber toe. Oh! he's a wonderful old man!"</p>

    <p>"I don't think it so strange, after all, on that account," said Flask. "If his leg were off at the hip, now, it
    would be a different thing. That would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other left, you
    know."</p>

    <p>"I don't know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel."</p>

    <p>Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering the paramount importance of his life to the
    success of the voyage, it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase.
    So Tamerlane's soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be
    carried into the thickest of the fight.</p>

    <p>But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight
    in all times of danger; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties;
    that every individual moment, indeed, then comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed
    man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought
    not.</p>

    <p>Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain
    comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his
    orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the
    hunt&mdash;above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat's crew, he well knew
    that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a
    boat's crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head. Nevertheless he had taken private
    measures of his own touching all that matter. Until Cabaco's published discovery, the sailors had little foreseen
    it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the customary business
    of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in
    the matter of making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even
    solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the
    bow: when all this was observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the
    bottom of the boat, as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety
    he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in
    the boat's bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how often he
    stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the
    carpenter's chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there; all these things, I say, had
    awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative
    heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his
    intention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest
    suspicion as to any boat's crew being assigned to that boat.</p>

    <p>Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane.
    Besides, now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and
    ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer
    castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off
    Japanese junks, and what not; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat
    with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle.</p>
