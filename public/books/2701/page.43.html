    <p>But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale, in his anatomy&mdash;there, at least,
    we shall be able to hit the right classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland whale's
    anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify
    the Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you will not find
    distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated. What then
    remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that
    way. And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only one that can possibly succeed, for it
    alone is practicable. To proceed.</p>

    <p>BOOK I. (FOLIO) CHAPTER IV. (HUMP-BACK).&mdash;This whale is often seen on the northern American coast. He has
    been frequently captured there, and towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you might call
    him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him,
    since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very valuable. He has baleen. He is the
    most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of
    them.</p>

    <p>BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER V. (RAZOR-BACK).&mdash;Of this whale little is known but his name. I have seen him at a
    distance off Cape Horn. Of a retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no coward, he has
    never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of
    him, nor does anybody else.</p>

    <p>BOOK I. (FOLIO), CHAPTER VI. (SULPHUR-BOTTOM).&mdash;Another retiring gentleman, with a brimstone belly,
    doubtless got by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen; at least I
    have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and then always at too great a distance to study his
    countenance. He is never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are told of him. Adieu,
    Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.</p>

    <p>Thus ends BOOK I. (FOLIO), and now begins BOOK II. (OCTAVO).</p>

    <p>OCTAVOES.*&mdash;These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which present may be numbered:&mdash;I.,
    the GRAMPUS; II., the BLACK FISH; III., the NARWHALE; IV., the THRASHER; V., the KILLER.</p>

    <p>*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain. Because, while the whales of this order,
    though smaller than those of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure, yet
    the bookbinder's Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the
    Octavo volume does.</p>

    <p>BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER I. (GRAMPUS).&mdash;Though this fish, whose loud sonorous breathing, or rather
    blowing, has furnished a proverb to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly
    classed among whales. But possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have
    recognised him for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and of
    corresponding dimensions round the waist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil is
    considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of
    the advance of the great sperm whale.</p>

    <p>BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER II. (BLACK FISH).&mdash;I give the popular fishermen's names for all these fish, for
    generally they are the best. Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and suggest
    another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called, because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So,
    call him the Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the circumstance that the inner angles
    of his lips are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale averages some
    sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal
    hooked fin in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more profitably employed, the sperm whale
    hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment&mdash;as some
    frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of
    odorous wax. Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of
    oil.</p>

    <p>BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER III. (NARWHALE), that is, NOSTRIL WHALE.&mdash;Another instance of a curiously named
    whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some
    sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet.
    Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from
    the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something
    analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would
    be hard to say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell
    me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it
    was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with
    ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own
    opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale&mdash;however that may be&mdash;it
    would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the
    Tusked whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be
    found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same
    sea-unicorn's horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison, and as such, preparations of
    it brought immense prices. It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way that the
    horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great
    curiosity. Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did
    gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames;
    "when Sir Martin returned from that voyage," saith Black Letter, "on bended knees he presented to her highness a
    prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor." An Irish author
    avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to
    a land beast of the unicorn nature.</p>
