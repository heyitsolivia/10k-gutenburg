    <p>But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason for that, ye lawyers!</p>

    <p>In his treatise on "Queen-Gold," or Queen-pinmoney, an old King's Bench author, one William Prynne, thus
    discourseth: "Ye tail is ye Queen's, that ye Queen's wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone." Now this was
    written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies' bodices.
    But this same bone is not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne.
    But is the Queen a mermaid, to be presented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.</p>

    <p>There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers&mdash;the whale and the sturgeon; both royal
    property under certain limitations, and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown's ordinary revenue. I know
    not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be
    divided in the same way as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish,
    which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there
    seems a reason in all things, even in law.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.</h2>
    <p>"In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry."
    SIR T. BROWNE, V.E.</p>

    <p>It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy,
    vapoury, mid-day sea, that the many noses on the Pequod's deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs
    of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea.</p>

    <p>"I will bet something now," said Stubb, "that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled
    the other day. I thought they would keel up before long."</p>

    <p>Presently, the vapours in advance slid aside; and there in the distance lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened
    that some sort of whale must be alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours from his peak;
    and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that
    the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on
    the sea, and so floated an unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must
    exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So
    intolerable indeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it. Yet are
    there those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very
    inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of attar-of-rose.</p>

    <p>Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman had a second whale alongside; and this
    second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those problematical
    whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies
    almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the proper place we shall see that no knowing
    fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted whales in
    general.</p>

    <p>The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled
    in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales.</p>

    <p>"There's a pretty fellow, now," he banteringly laughed, standing in the ship's bows, "there's a jackal for ye! I
    well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering their boats for
    breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of
    boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they will get won't be enough to dip the
    Captain's wick into; aye, we all know these things; but look ye, here's a Crappo that is content with our leavings,
    the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he
    has there. Poor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let's make him a present of a little oil for dear
    charity's sake. For what oil he'll get from that drugged whale there, wouldn't be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in
    a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I'll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these
    three masts of ours, than he'll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may contain
    something worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It's
    worth trying. Yes, I'm for it;" and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.</p>

    <p>By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped
    in the smell, with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb now called his
    boat's crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the
    fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was
    painted green, and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a
    symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read "Bouton de
    Rose,"&mdash;Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship.</p>

    <p>Though Stubb did not understand the BOUTON part of the inscription, yet the word ROSE, and the bulbous
    figure-head put together, sufficiently explained the whole to him.</p>

    <p>"A wooden rose-bud, eh?" he cried with his hand to his nose, "that will do very well; but how like all creation
    it smells!"</p>

    <p>Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he had to pull round the bows to the starboard
    side, and thus come close to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.</p>

    <p>Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he bawled&mdash;"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any
    of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak English?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be the chief-mate.</p>

    <p>"Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?"</p>

    <p>"WHAT whale?"</p>
