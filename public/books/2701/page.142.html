    <p>Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the whale, in his own osseous
    post-diluvian reality, as set down by the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.</p>

    <p>"Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams of which are made of Whale-Bones; for
    Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine, that by a secret
    Power bestowed by God upon the temple, no Whale can pass it without immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is,
    that on either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea, and wound the Whales when they
    light upon 'em. They keep a Whale's Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the Ground with its
    convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel's Back. This Rib
    (says John Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their Historians affirm, that a Prophet
    who prophesy'd of Mahomet, came from this Temple, and some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast
    forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple."</p>

    <p>In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will
    silently worship there.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 105. Does the Whale's Magnitude Diminish?&mdash;Will He Perish?</h2>
    <p>Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the head-waters of the Eternities, it may
    be fitly inquired, whether, in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the original bulk of
    his sires.</p>

    <p>But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those
    whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period prior to man), but of
    the whales found in that Tertiary system, those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its
    earlier ones.</p>

    <p>Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter,
    and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen, that the tape-measure
    gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen's authority,
    that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture.</p>

    <p>But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all
    previous geological periods; may it not be, that since Adam's time they have degenerated?</p>

    <p>Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient
    naturalists generally. For Pliny tells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others
    which measured eight hundred feet in length&mdash;Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of
    Banks and Solander, Cooke's naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain
    Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and
    sixty feet. And Lacepede, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his
    work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work
    was published so late as A.D. 1825.</p>

    <p>But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is as big as his ancestors in Pliny's time.
    And if ever I go where Pliny is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I cannot
    understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was
    born, do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other
    animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are drawn,
    just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in
    magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh's fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the whale
    alone should have degenerated.</p>

    <p>But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the
    almost omniscient look-outs at the mast-heads of the whaleships, now penetrating even through Behring's straits, and
    into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all
    continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a
    havoc; whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man, smoke his
    last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.</p>

    <p>Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo, which, not forty years ago, overspread by
    tens of thousands the prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with their
    thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous river-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a
    dollar an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that the hunted whale
    cannot now escape speedy extinction.</p>

    <p>But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a period ago&mdash;not a good lifetime&mdash;the
    census of the buffalo in Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day not one
    horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear
    of man; yet the far different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan.
    Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank
    God, if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters
    and trappers of the West, when the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness and a virgin, the
    same number of moccasined men, for the same number of months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would
    have slain not forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be statistically
    stated.</p>

    <p>Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for
    example, that in former years (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in small pods, were
    encountered much oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much
    more remunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by some views to safety, now
    swim the seas in immense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools
    of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally
    fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former
    years abounding with them, hence that species also is declining. For they are only being driven from promontory to
    cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been
    very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.</p>
