    <p>Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin, as in the case of a very large Sperm
    Whale, will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or rather
    weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea
    may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake
    of liquid as that. Reckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of
    the stuff of the whale's skin.</p>

    <p>In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents. Almost
    invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array, something
    like those in the finest Italian line engravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass
    substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is
    this all. In some instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but
    afford the ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious
    cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion. By my
    retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate
    representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper
    Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the
    Indian rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale
    presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular
    linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random aspect. I should say
    that those New England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact
    with vast floating icebergs&mdash;I should say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this
    particular. It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other
    whales; for I have most remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the species.</p>

    <p>A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale. It has already been said, that it
    is stript from him in long pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and
    significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better,
    an Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his
    body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What
    would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy
    surtout? True, other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed, are
    your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the
    lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs
    and warm blood. Freeze his blood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then&mdash;except after explanation&mdash;that
    this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be
    found at home, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard, they are
    sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued
    in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is
    warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer.</p>

    <p>It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality, and the rare virtue of
    thick walls, and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after the whale! Do
    thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep
    thy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter's, and like the great whale, retain, O man! in all
    seasons a temperature of thine own.</p>

    <p>But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections, how few are domed like St. Peter's! of
    creatures, how few vast as the whale!</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 69. The Funeral.</h2>
    <p>Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!</p>

    <p>The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble
    sepulchre; though changed in hue, it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal. Slowly it
    floats more and more away, the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed
    with rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale. The vast
    white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats, what seem square
    roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls, augment the murderous din. For hours and hours from the almost stationary
    ship that hideous sight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the pleasant sea,
    wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death floats on and on, till lost in infinite perspectives.</p>

    <p>There's a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all in pious mourning, the air-sharks all
    punctiliously in black or speckled. In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure he
    had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth!
    from which not the mightiest whale is free.</p>

    <p>Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare. Espied by
    some timid man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls,
    nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun, and the white spray heaving high against it;
    straightway the whale's unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the log&mdash;SHOALS, ROCKS, AND
    BREAKERS HEREABOUTS: BEWARE! And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly sheep
    leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held. There's your law of
    precedents; there's your utility of traditions; there's the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never
    bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in the air! There's orthodoxy!</p>
