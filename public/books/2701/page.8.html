    <p>All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of
    concluding his business operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before
    the light was put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.</p>

    <p>But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he
    examined the head of it for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed
    out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk
    between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of
    astonishment he began feeling me.</p>

    <p>Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against the wall, and then conjured him,
    whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural
    responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.</p>

    <p>"Who-e debel you?"&mdash;he at last said&mdash;"you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e." And so saying the lighted
    tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.</p>

    <p>"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!" shouted I. "Landlord! Watch! Coffin! Angels! save me!"</p>

    <p>"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!" again growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings
    of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But thank
    heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.</p>

    <p>"Don't be afraid now," said he, grinning again, "Queequeg here wouldn't harm a hair of your head."</p>

    <p>"Stop your grinning," shouted I, "and why didn't you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?"</p>

    <p>"I thought ye know'd it;&mdash;didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads around town?&mdash;but turn flukes again
    and go to sleep. Queequeg, look here&mdash;you sabbee me, I sabbee&mdash;you this man sleepe you&mdash;you
    sabbee?"</p>

    <p>"Me sabbee plenty"&mdash;grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed.</p>

    <p>"You gettee in," he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing the clothes to one side. He really did
    this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all his
    tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal. What's all this fuss I have been making about,
    thought I to myself&mdash;the man's a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as I have to
    be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.</p>

    <p>"Landlord," said I, "tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop
    smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him. But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It's
    dangerous. Besides, I ain't insured."</p>

    <p>This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned me to get into bed&mdash;rolling
    over to one side as much as to say&mdash;"I won't touch a leg of ye."</p>

    <p>"Good night, landlord," said I, "you may go."</p>

    <p>I turned in, and never slept better in my life.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.</h2>
    <p>Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm thrown over me in the most loving and
    affectionate manner. You had almost thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd
    little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan
    labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise shade&mdash;owing I suppose to his keeping his arm
    at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times&mdash;this same arm
    of his, I say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the
    arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was
    only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.</p>

    <p>My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a child, I well remember a somewhat similar
    circumstance that befell me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The circumstance
    was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other&mdash;I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had
    seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other, was all the time whipping me,
    or sending me to bed supperless,&mdash;my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed,
    though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I
    felt dreadfully. But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor, undressed
    myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.</p>

    <p>I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection.
    Sixteen hours in bed! the small of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in at the
    window, and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse
    and worse&mdash;at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother,
    and suddenly threw myself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my
    misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best
    and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay there broad awake,
    feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I
    must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it&mdash;half steeped in dreams&mdash;I
    opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running
    through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in
    mine. My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand
    belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the
    most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch,
    the horrid spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me; but waking in the
    morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding
    attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle myself with it.</p>
