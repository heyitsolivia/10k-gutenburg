    <p>Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck's tears the glue.</p>

    <p>"Oh, my captain, my captain!&mdash;noble heart&mdash;go not&mdash;go not!&mdash;see, it's a brave man that weeps;
    how great the agony of the persuasion then!"</p>

    <p>"Lower away!"&mdash;cried Ahab, tossing the mate's arm from him. "Stand by the crew!"</p>

    <p>In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.</p>

    <p>"The sharks! the sharks!" cried a voice from the low cabin-window there; "O master, my master, come back!"</p>

    <p>But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the boat leaped on.</p>

    <p>Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from
    out the dark waters beneath the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they dipped in the
    water; and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the
    whale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that
    vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that had been
    observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried; and whether it was that Ahab's crew were all
    such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks&mdash;a matter
    sometimes well known to affect them,&mdash;however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the
    others.</p>

    <p>"Heart of wrought steel!" murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and following with his eyes the receding
    boat&mdash;"canst thou yet ring boldly to that sight?&mdash;lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by
    them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?&mdash;For when three days flow together in one
    continuous intense pursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the evening and the
    end of that thing&mdash;be that end what it may. Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so
    deadly calm, yet expectant,&mdash;fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim before me, as in empty outlines
    and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim. Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to
    see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem clearing; but clouds sweep between&mdash;Is my
    journey's end coming? My legs feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,&mdash;beats it yet?
    Stir thyself, Starbuck!&mdash;stave it off&mdash;move, move! speak aloud!&mdash;Mast-head there! See ye my boy's
    hand on the hill?&mdash;Crazed;&mdash;aloft there!&mdash;keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Mark well the whale!&mdash;Ho! again!&mdash;drive off that hawk! see! he pecks&mdash;he tears the
    vane"&mdash;pointing to the red flag flying at the main-truck&mdash;"Ha! he soars away with it!&mdash;Where's the
    old man now? see'st thou that sight, oh Ahab!&mdash;shudder, shudder!"</p>

    <p>The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads&mdash;a downward pointed arm, Ahab knew
    that the whale had sounded; but intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a little sideways
    from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and
    hammered against the opposing bow.</p>

    <p>"Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a
    lid; and no coffin and no hearse can be mine:&mdash;and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!"</p>

    <p>Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding
    from a submerged berg of ice, swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a subterraneous hum;
    and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot
    lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the
    rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for an
    instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like
    new milk round the marble trunk of the whale.</p>

    <p>"Give way!" cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to the attack; but maddened by yesterday's
    fresh irons that corroded in him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven. The
    wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted
    together; as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more flailed them apart; spilling out the
    irons and lances from the two mates' boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows, but leaving
    Ahab's almost without a scar.</p>

    <p>While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the whale swimming out from them, turned, and
    showed one entire flank as he shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round and round to the
    fish's back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions
    of the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his
    distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.</p>

    <p>The harpoon dropped from his hand.</p>

    <p>"Befooled, befooled!"&mdash;drawing in a long lean breath&mdash;"Aye, Parsee! I see thee again.&mdash;Aye, and
    thou goest before; and this, THIS then is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of
    thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can
    in time, and return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die&mdash;Down, men! the first thing that but offers to jump
    from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey
    me.&mdash;Where's the whale? gone down again?"</p>

    <p>But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore, and as if the particular
    place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming
    forward; and had almost passed the ship,&mdash;which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him,
    though for the present her headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only
    intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea.</p>

    <p>"Oh! Ahab," cried Starbuck, "not too late is it, even now, the third day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee
    not. It is thou, thou, that madly seekest him!"</p>
