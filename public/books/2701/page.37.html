    <p>Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black negro-savage, with a lion-like tread&mdash;an
    Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called them
    ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on
    board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been anywhere in the world but in
    Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold
    life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained
    all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his
    socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag
    come to beg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little
    Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod's company, be it said, that at the
    present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are
    Americans born, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as
    with the American army and military and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction of
    the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the native American liberally
    provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling
    seamen belong to the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from
    the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put
    in at the Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage homewards, they drop them
    there again. How it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all
    Islanders in the Pequod, ISOLATOES too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but each ISOLATO
    living on a separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were! An
    Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in
    the Pequod to lay the world's grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back. Black
    Little Pip&mdash;he never did&mdash;oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod's forecastle, ye
    shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great
    quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here,
    hailed a hero there!</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 28. Ahab.</h2>
    <p>For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly
    relieved each other at the watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the only
    commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after
    all it was plain they but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto
    unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.</p>

    <p>Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were
    visible; for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea, became almost
    a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah's diabolical incoherences uninvitedly
    recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived of. But poorly could I withstand them, much
    as in other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the
    wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasiness&mdash;to call it so&mdash;which I felt, yet whenever
    I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions. For though the
    harpooneers, with the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the
    tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed
    this&mdash;and rightly ascribed it&mdash;to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian
    vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the
    ship, the mates, which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce confidence and
    cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage. Three better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own
    different way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a
    Cape man. Now, it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had biting Polar weather,
    though all the time running away from it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we
    sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable weather behind us. It was one of those less
    lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing
    through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the
    call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me.
    Reality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.</p>
