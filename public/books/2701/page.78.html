    <p>"'Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous
    North.'</p>

    <p>"'Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha's very fine; and ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our
    Canallers are; for such information may throw side-light upon my story.'</p>

    <p>"For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth of the state of New York; through
    numerous populous cities and most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent,
    cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great
    forests; on Roman arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or broken; through all the wide
    contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires
    stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life. There's your
    true Ashantee, gentlemen; there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you; under the long-flung
    shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches. For by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your
    metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most abound in
    holiest vicinities.</p>

    <p>"'Is that a friar passing?' said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the crowded plazza, with humorous
    concern.</p>

    <p>"'Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella's Inquisition wanes in Lima,' laughed Don Sebastian. 'Proceed,
    Senor.'</p>

    <p>"'A moment! Pardon!' cried another of the company. 'In the name of all us Limeese, I but desire to express to
    you, sir sailor, that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant
    Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look surprised; you know the proverb all along this
    coast&mdash;"Corrupt as Lima." It but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than billiard-tables, and
    for ever open&mdash;and "Corrupt as Lima." So, too, Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed
    evangelist, St. Mark!&mdash;St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now, you pour out again.'</p>

    <p>"Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and
    picturesquely wicked is he. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he indolently
    floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore,
    all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and
    gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he
    floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have
    received good turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it is often
    one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor
    stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is
    emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates, and that
    scarce any race of mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor does it at all
    diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line,
    the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian
    corn-field, and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.</p>

    <p>"'I see! I see!' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles. 'No need to
    travel! The world's one Lima. I had thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were cold and holy as
    the hills.&mdash;But the story.'</p>

    <p>"I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly had he done so, when he was surrounded by
    the three junior mates and the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down the ropes like
    baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the
    forecastle. Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out
    of harm's way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that
    atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border
    of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment.
    But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where,
    hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched
    themselves behind the barricade.</p>

    <p>"'Come out of that, ye pirates!' roared the captain, now menacing them with a pistol in each hand, just brought
    to him by the steward. 'Come out of that, ye cut-throats!'</p>

    <p>"Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied the worst the pistols could do; but
    gave the captain to understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt's) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny
    on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted,
    but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.</p>

    <p>"'Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?' demanded their ringleader.</p>

    <p>"'Turn to! turn to!&mdash;I make no promise;&mdash;to your duty! Do you want to sink the ship, by knocking off at
    a time like this? Turn to!' and he once more raised a pistol.</p>

    <p>"'Sink the ship?' cried Steelkilt. 'Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a
    rope-yarn against us. What say ye, men?' turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response.</p>

    <p>"The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on the Captain, and jerking out such
    sentences as these:&mdash;'It's not our fault; we didn't want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boy's
    business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger
    here against his cursed jaw; ain't those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes,
    my hearties. Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don't be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to turn
    to; treat us decently, and we're your men; but we won't be flogged.'</p>
