    <p>It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily
    dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,
    corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but felt the agonizing bodily
    laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long months of days
    and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling
    Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him
    mad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems
    all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed
    of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium,
    that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he
    swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild
    stun'sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium seemed left
    behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then,
    when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked
    God the direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a
    cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler
    form. Ahab's full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble
    Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not
    one jot of Ahab's broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural
    intellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If such a furious trope may
    stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its
    own mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold more
    potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.</p>

    <p>This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted. But vain to popularize profundities, and
    all truth is profound. Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here
    stand&mdash;however grand and wonderful, now quit it;&mdash;and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those
    vast Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of man's upper earth, his root of grandeur, his
    whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a
    broken throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his frozen
    brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A
    family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old
    State-secret come.</p>

    <p>Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet
    without power to kill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble; in some
    sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will
    determinate. Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at
    last, no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the terrible
    casualty which had overtaken him.</p>

    <p>The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all
    the added moodiness which always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage, sat
    brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage,
    on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit,
    that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of rage and
    wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of
    some incurable idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance
    against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,
    yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack. But be all
    this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had
    purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had
    any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how soon would their
    aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on profitable cruises,
    the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural
    revenge.</p>

    <p>Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a Job's whale round the world, at the head
    of a crew, too, chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals&mdash;morally enfeebled also, by
    the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the invunerable jollity of indifference and
    recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially picked and
    packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so aboundingly
    responded to the old man's ire&mdash;by what evil magic their souls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed
    almost theirs; the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to be&mdash;what the White
    Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have
    seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,&mdash;all this to explain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael
    can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting,
    muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can
    stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to
    encounter the whale, could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.</p>
