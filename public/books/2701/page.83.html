    <p>Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit of the young and tender, free from
    the same heinousness of mistake. Look at that popular work "Goldsmith's Animated Nature." In the abridged London
    edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged "whale" and a "narwhale." I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this
    unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze
    one, that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of
    schoolboys.</p>

    <p>Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great naturalist, published a scientific systemized
    whale book, wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these are not only
    incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a
    long experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its counterpart in nature.</p>

    <p>But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific Frederick
    Cuvier, brother to the famous Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what he
    calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your
    summary retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of
    course, he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that picture, who
    can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic
    abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many
    queer cups and saucers inform us.</p>

    <p>As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of
    them? They are generally Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting on three or four
    sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue
    paint.</p>

    <p>But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all. Consider! Most of the
    scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked
    ship, with broken back, would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and
    spars. Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself
    for his portrait. The living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable
    waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that
    element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to preserve all
    his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young
    sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales
    hoisted to a ship's deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise
    expression the devil himself could not catch.</p>

    <p>But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale, accurate hints may be derived touching
    his true form. Not at all. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives
    very little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library
    of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy's
    other leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan's articulated
    bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully
    invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is
    strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously
    displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the
    thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are
    permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. "However recklessly the
    whale may sometimes serve us," said humorous Stubb one day, "he can never be truly said to handle us without
    mittens."</p>

    <p>For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that
    one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer
    than another, but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of
    finding out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable
    idea of his living contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being
    eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity
    touching this Leviathan.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True</h2>
    <p>Pictures of Whaling Scenes.</p>

    <p>In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more
    monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in Pliny,
    Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass that matter by.</p>

    <p>I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale; Colnett's, Huggins's, Frederick Cuvier's, and
    Beale's. In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins's is far better than theirs; but,
    by great odds, Beale's is the best. All Beale's drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in the
    picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm
    Whales, though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably correct and
    life-like in its general effect. Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour;
    but they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.</p>
