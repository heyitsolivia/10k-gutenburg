    <p>In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captain's
    table, was the entire care-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the
    harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the
    harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords; they filled
    their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego,
    that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great
    baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go
    with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his
    back, harpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory by snatching him up
    bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out
    the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this
    bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of
    the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life
    was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he
    would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds
    of its door, till all was over.</p>

    <p>It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise
    to them, Daggoo seated on the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines; at
    every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes
    passenger in a ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty. It seemed
    hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,
    baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element
    of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or by bread, are
    giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating&mdash;an ugly sound
    enough&mdash;so much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his
    own lean arms. And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be
    picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits
    of the palsy. Nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their lances and other
    weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound
    did not at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his Island days, Queequeg, for one,
    must certainly have been guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white
    waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to
    his great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all
    their martial bones jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.</p>

    <p>But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived there; still, being anything but sedentary
    in their habits, they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time, when they passed
    through it to their own peculiar quarters.</p>

    <p>In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains, who, as a set, rather incline to
    the opinion that by rights the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is,
    at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be
    said to have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it was something as a street-door enters
    a house; turning inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing, residing in the
    open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though
    nominally included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the world, as the last of
    the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the
    woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his
    inclement, howling old age, Ahab's soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of
    its gloom!</p>

    <p>It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast-head came
    round.</p>

    <p>In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port;
    even though she may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground. And if,
    after a three, four, or five years' voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her&mdash;say, an empty
    vial even&mdash;then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the
    spires of the port, does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.</p>
