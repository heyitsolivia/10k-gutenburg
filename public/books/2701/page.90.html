    <p>"Pull up&mdash;pull up!" he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath. "Pull
    up!&mdash;close to!" and the boat ranged along the fish's flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly
    churned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously
    seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of breaking ere
    he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for,
    starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his "flurry," the monster horribly wallowed in his
    blood, overwrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping
    astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.</p>

    <p>And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view; surging from side to side; spasmodically
    dilating and contracting his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush after gush of
    clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again,
    ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!</p>

    <p>"He's dead, Mr. Stubb," said Daggoo.</p>

    <p>"Yes; both pipes smoked out!" and withdrawing his own from his mouth, Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the
    water; and, for a moment, stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 62. The Dart.</h2>
    <p>A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.</p>

    <p>According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes off from the ship, with the headsman or
    whale-killer as temporary steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar, the one known as
    the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is
    called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however
    prolonged and exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed,
    he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated
    loud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one's compass, while all the other
    muscles are strained and half started&mdash;what that is none know but those who have tried it. For one, I cannot
    bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time. In this straining, bawling state, then, with
    his back to the fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry&mdash;"Stand up, and give it to
    him!" He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch,
    and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the whole
    fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that so
    many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their
    blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder
    that to many ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage, and if
    you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted!</p>

    <p>Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant, that is, when the whale starts to run, the
    boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every
    one else. It is then they change places; and the headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper
    station in the bows of the boat.</p>

    <p>Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both foolish and unnecessary. The headsman should
    stay in the bows from first to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing whatever should be
    expected of him, except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a
    slight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me
    that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as
    the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them.</p>

    <p>To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of
    idleness, and not from out of toil.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 63. The Crotch.</h2>
    <p>Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in productive subjects, grow the chapters.</p>

    <p>The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention. It is a notched stick of a peculiar form,
    some two feet in length, which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow, for the purpose
    of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from
    the prow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a
    backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch,
    respectively called the first and second irons.</p>

    <p>But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the line; the object being this: to dart
    them both, if possible, one instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one
    should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that
    owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it becomes
    impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him.
    Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon
    must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible
    jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box
    line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable. But this
    critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties.</p>
