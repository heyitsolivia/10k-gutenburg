    <p>When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he lightly shouldered the coffin and went
    forward with it, inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.</p>

    <p>Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away,
    Queequeg, to every one's consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him, nor was there
    any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will
    shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.</p>

    <p>Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye. He then called for his
    harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the
    paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of
    fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece
    of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he might
    make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and
    bring out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid
    (hatch he called it) to be placed over him. The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg
    in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view. "Rarmai" (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at
    last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.</p>

    <p>But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all this while, drew nigh to him where he lay,
    and with soft sobbings, took him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.</p>

    <p>"Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where go ye now? But if the currents carry ye to
    those sweet Antilles where the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little errand for me? Seek
    out one Pip, who's now been missing long: I think he's in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for
    he must be very sad; for look! he's left his tambourine behind;&mdash;I found it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now,
    Queequeg, die; and I'll beat ye your dying march."</p>

    <p>"I have heard," murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, "that in violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have
    talked in ancient tongues; and that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten
    childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond
    faith, poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes. Where
    learned he that, but there?&mdash;Hark! he speaks again: but more wildly now."</p>

    <p>"Form two and two! Let's make a General of him! Ho, where's his harpoon? Lay it across here.&mdash;Rig-a-dig,
    dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!&mdash;mind ye that;
    Queequeg dies game!&mdash;take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game! I say; game, game, game! but base little
    Pip, he died a coward; died all a'shiver;&mdash;out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the Antilles he's a
    runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat! I'd never beat my tambourine over base
    Pip, and hail him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame upon all cowards&mdash;shame upon them!
    Let 'em go drown like Pip, that jumped from a whale-boat. Shame! shame!"</p>

    <p>During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip was led away, and the sick man was replaced
    in his hammock.</p>

    <p>But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that his coffin was proved a good fit,
    Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and thereupon, when some expressed
    their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;&mdash;at a
    critical moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone; and therefore had changed
    his mind about dying: he could not die yet, he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of
    his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a man
    made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent,
    ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.</p>

    <p>Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be
    six months convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day. So, in good time my
    Queequeg gained strength; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a
    vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching,
    yawned a little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself
    fit for a fight.</p>

    <p>With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes,
    set them in order there. Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and
    drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his
    body. And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic
    marks, had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical treatise on the
    art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one
    volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own live heart beat against them; and these
    mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed,
    and so be unsolved to the last. And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of
    his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg&mdash;"Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!"</p>

    <p>When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea; were it not for other things, I
    could have greeted my dear Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my youth was answered;
    that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue.</p>
