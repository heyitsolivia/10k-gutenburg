    <p>"Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice
    him, but unawed, went on with his gay banterings.</p>

    <p>"'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one of ye, and let's have a taste. By the
    Lord, it's worth bottling! I tell ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had best cut away his part
    of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he's come back again with a gang
    of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting
    and slashing at the bottom; making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I'd tell him to jump overboard
    and scatter 'em. They're playing the devil with his estate, I can tell him. But he's a simple old soul,&mdash;Rad,
    and a beauty too. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I wonder if he'd give a
    poor devil like me the model of his nose.'</p>

    <p>"'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared Radney, pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk.
    'Thunder away at it!'</p>

    <p>"'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. 'Lively, boys, lively, now!' And with that the pump clanged
    like fifty fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was
    heard which denotes the fullest tension of life's utmost energies.</p>

    <p>"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went forward all panting, and sat himself down
    on the windlass; his face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now what
    cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated
    state, I know not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom
    and sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to
    run at large.</p>

    <p>"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales
    is regularly attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the
    time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of
    whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all vessels this broom business is the
    prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had
    been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had
    been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial
    business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all these
    particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.</p>

    <p>"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult
    Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this;
    and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he
    sat still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's malignant eye and perceived the stacks of
    powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all
    this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful
    being&mdash;a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved&mdash;this nameless
    phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.</p>

    <p>"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in, he
    answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without at all
    alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps,
    had done little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous
    manner unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted
    cooper's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.</p>

    <p>"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for all his first nameless feeling of
    forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still smothering the
    conflagration within him, without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney
    shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.</p>

    <p>"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily followed by the mate with his menacing
    hammer, deliberately repeated his intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the slightest
    effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man;
    but it was to no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass; when, resolved at last no
    longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused
    on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:</p>

    <p>"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to yourself.' But the predestinated mate coming
    still closer to him, where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth;
    meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions. Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing
    him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and
    creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would murder
    him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the
    cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a
    whale.</p>

    <p>"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his
    comrades were standing their mastheads. They were both Canallers.</p>

    <p>"'Canallers!' cried Don Pedro. 'We have seen many whale-ships in our harbours, but never heard of your Canallers.
    Pardon: who and what are they?'</p>

    <p>"'Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal. You must have heard of it.'</p>
