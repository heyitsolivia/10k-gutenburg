    <p>"Now Jonah's Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it
    only in the penniless. In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a passport;
    whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So Jonah's Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah's
    purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it's assented to. Then the Captain knows
    that Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold. Yet when
    Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a
    counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage. 'Point out my state-room,
    Sir,' says Jonah now, 'I'm travel-weary; I need sleep.' 'Thou lookest like it,' says the Captain, 'there's thy
    room.' Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there,
    the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of convicts' cells being never allowed to
    be locked within. All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the little
    state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole,
    sunk, too, beneath the ship's water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the
    whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels' wards.</p>

    <p>"Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah's room; and the ship, heeling
    over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion,
    still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it
    but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his
    berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his
    restless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side,
    are all awry. 'Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!' he groans, 'straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my
    soul are all in crookedness!'</p>

    <p>"Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still reeling, but with conscience yet pricking
    him, as the plungings of the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as one who in
    that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed;
    and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for
    conscience is the wound, and there's naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah's prodigy
    of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.</p>

    <p>"And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship
    for Tarshish, all careening, glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers! the
    contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is
    like to break. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering
    overboard; when the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with trampling feet right
    over Jonah's head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea,
    feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with
    open mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship&mdash;a
    berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in
    his dead ear, 'What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!' Startled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers
    to his feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he is sprung
    upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy
    vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat. And ever, as the white
    moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing
    bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.</p>

    <p>"Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too
    plainly known. The sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test
    the truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this
    great tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah's; that discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their
    questions. 'What is thine occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now, my shipmates, the
    behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an
    answer to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is
    forced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.</p>

    <p>"'I am a Hebrew,' he cries&mdash;and then&mdash;'I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the
    dry land!' Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN! Straightway, he now goes on to make a
    full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not
    yet supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts,&mdash;when wretched Jonah
    cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for HIS sake this great tempest was
    upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant
    gale howls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of
    Jonah.</p>

    <p>"And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when instantly an oily calmness floats out
    from the east, and the sea is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind. He goes
    down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething
    into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his
    prison. Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish's belly. But observe his prayer, and learn a weighty lesson.
    For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is
    just. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he
    will still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not clamorous for
    pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual
    deliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin
    but I do place him before you as a model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like
    Jonah."</p>
