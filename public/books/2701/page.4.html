    <p>But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous, black mass of something hovering in the
    centre of the picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy,
    squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained,
    unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to
    find out what that marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart you
    through.&mdash;It's the Black Sea in a midnight gale.&mdash;It's the unnatural combat of the four primal
    elements.&mdash;It's a blasted heath.&mdash;It's a Hyperborean winter scene.&mdash;It's the breaking-up of the
    icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture's
    midst. THAT once found out, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a
    gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?</p>

    <p>In fact, the artist's design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly based upon the aggregated opinions of
    many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane;
    the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,
    purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.</p>

    <p>The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some
    were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and one
    was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed
    mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a
    death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and
    harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty
    years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon&mdash;so like a
    corkscrew now&mdash;was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of
    Blanco. The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man,
    travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the hump.</p>

    <p>Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way&mdash;cut through what in old times must have been a
    great central chimney with fireplaces all round&mdash;you enter the public room. A still duskier place is this, with
    such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old
    craft's cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously. On one
    side stood a long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities gathered from
    this wide world's remotest nooks. Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den&mdash;the
    bar&mdash;a rude attempt at a right whale's head. Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the
    whale's jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old
    decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed
    they called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and
    death.</p>

    <p>Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true cylinders without&mdash;within, the
    villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians rudely
    pecked into the glass, surround these footpads' goblets. Fill to THIS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS
    a penny more; and so on to the full glass&mdash;the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling.</p>

    <p>Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a table, examining by a dim light divers
    specimens of SKRIMSHANDER. I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room, received
    for answer that his house was full&mdash;not a bed unoccupied. "But avast," he added, tapping his forehead, "you
    haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer's blanket, have ye? I s'pose you are goin' a-whalin', so you'd better
    get used to that sort of thing."</p>

    <p>I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever do so, it would depend upon who the
    harpooneer might be, and that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was not
    decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up
    with the half of any decent man's blanket.</p>

    <p>"I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?&mdash;you want supper? Supper'll be ready directly."</p>

    <p>I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was
    still further adorning it with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his
    legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn't make much headway, I thought.</p>

    <p>At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland&mdash;no
    fire at all&mdash;the landlord said he couldn't afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding
    sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen
    fingers. But the fare was of the most substantial kind&mdash;not only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good
    heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most
    direful manner.</p>

    <p>"My boy," said the landlord, "you'll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty."</p>

    <p>"Landlord," I whispered, "that aint the harpooneer is it?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, no," said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, "the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never
    eats dumplings, he don't&mdash;he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare."</p>

    <p>"The devil he does," says I. "Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?"</p>

    <p>"He'll be here afore long," was the answer.</p>

    <p>I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this "dark complexioned" harpooneer. At any rate, I made
    up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into bed before I
    did.</p>
