    <p>In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too, of honest wonders&mdash;the voyage of
    Lionel Wafer, one of ancient Dampier's old chums&mdash;I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted
    from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example, if such be needed.</p>

    <p>Lionel, it seems, was on his way to "John Ferdinando," as he calls the modern Juan Fernandes. "In our way
    thither," he says, "about four o'clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the
    Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell
    where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and
    violent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over,
    we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground..... The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their
    carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun,
    was thrown out of his cabin!" Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate
    the imputation by stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief along
    the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was
    after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.</p>

    <p>I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to me, of the great power and malice at
    times of the sperm whale. In more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing boats back
    to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The
    English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me say, that there have been
    examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and
    secured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is
    very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with
    blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some
    eloquent indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and retain it in
    that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more and a concluding
    illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most
    marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all
    marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon&mdash;Verily
    there is nothing new under the sun.</p>

    <p>In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when
    Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every way
    of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating
    historian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.</p>

    <p>Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople, a
    great sea-monster was captured in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels at
    intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot
    easily be gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster was, is not
    mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly
    inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been
    always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas
    are not, and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious
    resort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated
    instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary
    coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily
    passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the
    Propontis.</p>

    <p>In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance called BRIT is to be found, the aliment
    of the right whale. But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale&mdash;squid or
    cuttle-fish&mdash;lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures, but by no means the largest of that
    sort, have been found at its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and reason upon them a
    bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all human reasoning, Procopius's sea-monster, that for half a
    century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm whale.</p>

    <p>Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the
    ultimate capture of Moby Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion;
    nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman's ways,
    altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if this were otherwise, there were not
    wanting other motives much more influential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even considering his
    monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some
    degree to all sperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that
    each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed
    exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which, though not so strictly according with the wildness
    of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.</p>
