    <p>There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in the course of this business, but which I
    feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation original with the
    whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance. It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found
    in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I hold it to be the wondrously thin,
    ruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.</p>

    <p>Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm
    fishermen. It designates the dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right
    whale, and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.</p>

    <p>Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale's vocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes
    so. A whaleman's nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan's tail: it
    averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along
    the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with
    it all impurities.</p>

    <p>But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once to descend into the blubber-room, and
    have a long talk with its inmates. This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the
    blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents,
    this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by a dull lantern, a space
    has been left clear for the workmen. They generally go in pairs,&mdash;a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The
    whaling-pike is similar to a frigate's boarding-weapon of the same name. The gaff is something like a boat-hook.
    With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches
    and lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into the
    portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make it; the spademan's feet are shoeless; the thing he
    stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one
    of his assistants', would you be very much astonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 95. The Cassock.</h2>
    <p>Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you
    strolled forward nigh the windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very
    strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the
    wondrous cistern in the whale's huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his
    symmetrical tail; none of these would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,&mdash;longer
    than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg.
    And an idol, indeed, it is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that found in the secret
    groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for worshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the
    idol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book
    of Kings.</p>

    <p>Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and assisted by two allies, heavily backs the
    grandissimus, as the mariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier
    carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to
    remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt inside out, like a
    pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread,
    in the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of it, towards the pointed
    extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it.
    The mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his order, this
    investiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.</p>

    <p>That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the pots; an operation which is conducted at a
    curious wooden horse, planted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath it, into which the
    minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator's desk. Arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous
    pulpit; intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this mincer!*</p>

    <p>*Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer. It enjoins him to be
    careful, and cut his work into as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the
    oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.</h2>
    <p>Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try-works. She presents the
    curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship. It is as if
    from the open field a brick-kiln were transported to her planks.</p>

    <p>The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath
    are of a peculiar strength, fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar, some ten feet
    by eight square, and five in height. The foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly secured
    to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the
    flanks it is cased with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened hatchway. Removing this
    hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in number, and each of several barrels' capacity. When not in use, they are
    kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver
    punch-bowls. During the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there
    for a nap. While employed in polishing them&mdash;one man in each pot, side by side&mdash;many confidential
    communications are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation. It was
    in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first indirectly
    struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will
    descend from any point in precisely the same time.</p>
