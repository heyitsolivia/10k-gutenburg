    <p>The beef was fine&mdash;tough, but with body in it. They said it was bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary
    beef; but I do not know, for certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial, symmetrically
    globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you could feel them, and roll them about in you after they
    were swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The
    bread&mdash;but that couldn't be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread contained the only
    fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner
    when you ate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions of the cook's boilers,
    including his own live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of good fare and
    plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.</p>

    <p>But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other English whalers I know of&mdash;not all
    though&mdash;were such famous, hospitable ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the
    joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I will tell you. The abounding good cheer of
    these English whalers is matter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of historical whale
    research, when it has seemed needed.</p>

    <p>The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders, Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived
    many terms still extant in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching plenty to eat and
    drink. For, as a general thing, the English merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in
    the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural, but incidental and particular; and,
    therefore, must have some special origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.</p>

    <p>During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty
    whaling smell of it, I knew must be about whalers. The title was, "Dan Coopman," wherefore I concluded that this
    must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I
    was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one "Fitz Swackhammer." But my friend Dr.
    Snodhead, a very learned man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and St. Pott's,
    to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble&mdash;this same Dr.
    Snodhead, so soon as he spied the book, assured me that "Dan Coopman" did not mean "The Cooper," but "The Merchant."
    In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects,
    contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it was, headed, "Smeer," or "Fat,"
    that I found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from
    which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:</p>

    <p>400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000
    lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins of butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel &amp; Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an
    inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of beer.</p>

    <p>Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in the present case, however, where the reader
    is flooded with whole pipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.</p>

    <p>At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer, beef, and bread, during which many
    profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic application; and,
    furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed
    by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery. In the first place, the
    amount of butter, and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their naturally
    unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation, and especially by their
    pursuing their game in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the convivial
    natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.</p>

    <p>The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted
    in the short summer of that climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen, including the short
    voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their
    fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer
    per man, for a twelve weeks' allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin. Now, whether
    these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand
    up in a boat's head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at
    them, and hit them too. But this was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution;
    upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and
    boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.</p>

    <p>But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high
    livers; and that the English whalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when cruising in an
    empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the world, get a good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties
    the decanter.</p>

    <p>Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer
    aspect; or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough sweeping
    comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still further, and untagging the points of his hose,
    unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones, set him
    before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton.</p>
