    <p>"Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and ye mates, flank me with your lances; and
    ye harpooneers, stand there with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some sort revive a
    noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men, you will yet see that&mdash;Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies
    come not sooner. Hand it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, were't not thou St. Vitus'
    imp&mdash;away, thou ague!</p>

    <p>"Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me touch the axis." So saying, with extended
    arm, he grasped the three level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing, suddenly and nervously
    twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by
    some nameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the
    Leyden jar of his own magnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic aspect. Stubb
    and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright.</p>

    <p>"In vain!" cried Ahab; "but, maybe, 'tis well. For did ye three but once take the full-forced shock, then mine
    own electric thing, THAT had perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye dead. Perchance
    ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen
    there&mdash;yon three most honourable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain the task? What, when
    the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension,
    THAT shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!"</p>

    <p>Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the detached iron part of their harpoons, some
    three feet long, held, barbs up, before him.</p>

    <p>"Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye not the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So,
    so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance. The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!" Forthwith, slowly going from one
    officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.</p>

    <p>"Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow them, ye who are now made parties to this
    indissoluble league. Ha! Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it. Drink, ye
    harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful whaleboat's bow&mdash;Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us
    all, if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!" The long, barbed steel goblets were lifted; and to cries and
    maledictions against the white whale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled, and
    turned, and shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when,
    waving his free hand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 37. Sunset.</h2>
    <p>THE CABIN; BY THE STERN WINDOWS; AHAB SITTING ALONE, AND GAZING OUT.</p>

    <p>I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er I sail. The envious billows sidelong swell
    to whelm my track; let them; but first I pass.</p>

    <p>Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet's rim, the warm waves blush like wine. The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver
    sun&mdash;slow dived from noon&mdash;goes down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the
    crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not
    its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. 'Tis iron&mdash;that I
    know&mdash;not gold. 'Tis split, too&mdash;that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against
    the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!</p>

    <p>Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This
    lovely light, it lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne'er enjoy. Gifted with the high
    perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of
    Paradise! Good night&mdash;good night! (WAVING HIS HAND, HE MOVES FROM THE WINDOW.)</p>

    <p>'Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least; but my one cogged circle fits into all
    their various wheels, and they revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all stand before me;
    and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the match itself must needs be wasting! What I've dared, I've
    willed; and what I've willed, I'll do! They think me mad&mdash;Starbuck does; but I'm demoniac, I am madness
    maddened! That wild madness that's only calm to comprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered;
    and&mdash;Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and
    the fulfiller one. That's more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye
    pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies&mdash;Take some one of
    your own size; don't pommel ME! No, ye've knocked me down, and I am up again; but YE have run and hidden. Come forth
    from behind your cotton bags! I have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab's compliments to ye; come and see if ye can
    swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my
    fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run. Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled
    hearts of mountains, under torrents' beds, unerringly I rush! Naught's an obstacle, naught's an angle to the iron
    way!</p>

    <p>BY THE MAINMAST; STARBUCK LEANING AGAINST IT.</p>

    <p>My soul is more than matched; she's overmanned; and by a madman! Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground
    arms on such a field! But he drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I see his impious end;
    but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill I, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I
    have no knife to cut. Horrible old man! Who's over him, he cries;&mdash;aye, he would be a democrat to all above;
    look, how he lords it over all below! Oh! I plainly see my miserable office,&mdash;to obey, rebelling; and worse
    yet, to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid woe would shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there
    hope. Time and tide flow wide. The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the small gold-fish has its
    glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God may wedge aside. I would up heart, were it not like lead. But my
    whole clock's run down; my heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to lift again.</p>
