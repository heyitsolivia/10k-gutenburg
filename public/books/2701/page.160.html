    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 126. The Life-Buoy.</h2>
    <p>Steering now south-eastward by Ahab's levelled steel, and her progress solely determined by Ahab's level log and
    line; the Pequod held on her path towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters,
    descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all
    these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene.</p>

    <p>At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep
    darkness that goes before the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch&mdash;then headed by
    Flask&mdash;was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly&mdash;like half-articulated wailings of the
    ghosts of all Herod's murdered Innocents&mdash;that one and all, they started from their reveries, and for the space
    of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild
    cry remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but
    the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman&mdash;the oldest mariner of all&mdash;declared that
    the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea.</p>

    <p>Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he came to the deck; it was then recounted
    to him by Flask, not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus explained the
    wonder.</p>

    <p>Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals, and some young seals that had
    lost their dams, or some dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her,
    crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail. But this only the more affected some of them, because most
    mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not only from their peculiar tones when in
    distress, but also from the human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising from
    the water alongside. In the sea, under certain circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for men.</p>

    <p>But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their
    number that morning. At sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore; and whether it was
    that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was
    thus with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had not been long at his perch, when a cry
    was heard&mdash;a cry and a rushing&mdash;and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and looking down, a
    little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea.</p>

    <p>The life-buoy&mdash;a long slender cask&mdash;was dropped from the stern, where it always hung obedient to a
    cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that
    it slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore; and the studded iron-bound cask followed the
    sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.</p>

    <p>And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the White Whale, on the White Whale's
    own peculiar ground; that man was swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the time. Indeed,
    in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a
    foreshadowing of evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged. They declared that now they
    knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before. But again the old Manxman said nay.</p>

    <p>The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see to it; but as no cask of sufficient
    lightness could be found, and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage, all
    hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to
    be; therefore, they were going to leave the ship's stern unprovided with a buoy, when by certain strange signs and
    inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin.</p>

    <p>"A life-buoy of a coffin!" cried Starbuck, starting.</p>

    <p>"Rather queer, that, I should say," said Stubb.</p>

    <p>"It will make a good enough one," said Flask, "the carpenter here can arrange it easily."</p>

    <p>"Bring it up; there's nothing else for it," said Starbuck, after a melancholy pause. "Rig it, carpenter; do not
    look at me so&mdash;the coffin, I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it."</p>

    <p>"And shall I nail down the lid, sir?" moving his hand as with a hammer.</p>

    <p>"Aye."</p>

    <p>"And shall I caulk the seams, sir?" moving his hand as with a caulking-iron.</p>

    <p>"Aye."</p>

    <p>"And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?" moving his hand as with a pitch-pot.</p>

    <p>"Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and no more.&mdash;Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come
    forward with me."</p>
