    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 43. Hark!</h2>
    <p>"HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?"</p>

    <p>It was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a cordon, extending from one of the
    fresh-water butts in the waist, to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the buckets to
    fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful
    not to speak or rustle their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence, only broken by the
    occasional flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.</p>

    <p>It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon, whose post was near the after-hatches,
    whispered to his neighbor, a Cholo, the words above.</p>

    <p>"Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?"</p>

    <p>"Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d'ye mean?"</p>

    <p>"There it is again&mdash;under the hatches&mdash;don't you hear it&mdash;a cough&mdash;it sounded like a
    cough."</p>

    <p>"Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket."</p>

    <p>"There again&mdash;there it is!&mdash;it sounds like two or three sleepers turning over, now!"</p>

    <p>"Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It's the three soaked biscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of
    ye&mdash;nothing else. Look to the bucket!"</p>

    <p>"Say what ye will, shipmate; I've sharp ears."</p>

    <p>"Aye, you are the chap, ain't ye, that heard the hum of the old Quakeress's knitting-needles fifty miles at sea
    from Nantucket; you're the chap."</p>

    <p>"Grin away; we'll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet
    been seen on deck; and I suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell Flask, one morning
    watch, that there was something of that sort in the wind."</p>

    <p>"Tish! the bucket!"</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 44. The Chart.</h2>
    <p>Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that
    wild ratification of his purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom, and bringing
    out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating
    himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye;
    and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank. At intervals, he would
    refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on various former
    voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.</p>

    <p>While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head, continually rocked with the motion
    of the ship, and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it almost seemed
    that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also
    tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.</p>

    <p>But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts.
    Almost every night they were brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and others were
    substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies,
    with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.</p>

    <p>Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it might seem an absurdly hopeless task
    thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to Ahab, who
    knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale's food; and, also,
    calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable
    surmises, almost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search
    of his prey.</p>

    <p>So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale's resorting to given waters,
    that many hunters believe that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world; were the logs for one
    voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to
    correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have
    been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*</p>

    <pre xml:space="preserve">*Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by an official circular,
    issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it appears
    that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and portions of it are presented in the circular. "This
    chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude; perpendicularly
    through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which
    districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district, and
    the two others to show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been seen."</pre>
    <p>Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the sperm whales, guided by some infallible
    instinct&mdash;say, rather, secret intelligence from the Deity&mdash;mostly swim in VEINS, as they are called;
    continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course,
    by any chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the direction taken by any one
    whale be straight as a surveyor's parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own
    unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary VEIN in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces
    some few miles in width (more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual
    sweep from the whale-ship's mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at
    particular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked
    for.</p>

    <p>And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter
    his prey; but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art, so place and time
    himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.</p>
