    <p>"It was he, it was he!" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended breath.</p>

    <p>"And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin."</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye&mdash;they were mine&mdash;MY irons," cried Ahab, exultingly&mdash;"but on!"</p>

    <p>"Give me a chance, then," said the Englishman, good-humoredly. "Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white
    head and hump, runs all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!</p>

    <p>"Aye, I see!&mdash;wanted to part it; free the fast-fish&mdash;an old trick&mdash;I know him."</p>

    <p>"How it was exactly," continued the one-armed commander, "I do not know; but in biting the line, it got foul of
    his teeth, caught there somehow; but we didn't know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line, bounce
    we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other whale's; that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how
    matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was&mdash;the noblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life&mdash;I
    resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get
    loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat's crew for a pull on a whale-line);
    seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate's boat&mdash;Mr. Mounttop's here (by the way,
    Captain&mdash;Mounttop; Mounttop&mdash;the captain);&mdash;as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop's boat, which,
    d'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather
    have it. But, Lord, look you, sir&mdash;hearts and souls alive, man&mdash;the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind
    as a bat&mdash;both eyes out&mdash;all befogged and bedeadened with black foam&mdash;the whale's tail looming
    straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was
    groping at midday, with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to toss it
    overboard&mdash;down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,
    flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all chips. We all struck out. To escape his
    terrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking
    fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down
    like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here" (clapping his hand just
    below his shoulder); "yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell's flames, I was thinking; when,
    when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh&mdash;clear along the whole length
    of my arm&mdash;came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;&mdash;and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by
    the way, captain&mdash;Dr. Bunger, ship's surgeon: Bunger, my lad,&mdash;the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your
    part of the yarn."</p>

    <p>The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the time standing near them, with nothing
    specific visible, to denote his gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober one; he was
    dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention
    between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other, occasionally casting a critical glance
    at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains. But, at his superior's introduction of him to Ahab, he politely
    bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain's bidding.</p>

    <p>"It was a shocking bad wound," began the whale-surgeon; "and, taking my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our
    old Sammy&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship," interrupted the one-armed captain, addressing Ahab; "go on, boy."</p>

    <p>"Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing hot weather there on the Line. But it was no
    use&mdash;I did all I could; sat up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oh, very severe!" chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly altering his voice, "Drinking hot rum toddies
    with me every night, till he couldn't see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half seas over, about three
    o'clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher,
    and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why don't ye? You know you're a precious
    jolly rascal.) But, heave ahead, boy, I'd rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man."</p>

    <p>"My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir"&mdash;said the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger,
    slightly bowing to Ahab&mdash;"is apt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. But I
    may as well say&mdash;en passant, as the French remark&mdash;that I myself&mdash;that is to say, Jack Bunger, late
    of the reverend clergy&mdash;am a strict total abstinence man; I never drink&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Water!" cried the captain; "he never drinks it; it's a sort of fits to him; fresh water throws him into the
    hydrophobia; but go on&mdash;go on with the arm story."</p>

    <p>"Yes, I may as well," said the surgeon, coolly. "I was about observing, sir, before Captain Boomer's facetious
    interruption, that spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse; the truth was,
    sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with
    the lead line. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came. But I had no hand in shipping
    that ivory arm there; that thing is against all rule"&mdash;pointing at it with the marlingspike&mdash;"that is the
    captain's work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the end, to
    knock some one's brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical passions sometimes. Do
    ye see this dent, sir"&mdash;removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his
    skull, but which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a wound&mdash;"Well, the
    captain there will tell you how that came here; he knows."</p>

    <p>"No, I don't," said the captain, "but his mother did; he was born with it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you&mdash;you
    Bunger! was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in pickle,
    you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal."</p>

    <p>"What became of the White Whale?" now cried Ahab, who thus far had been impatiently listening to this by-play
    between the two Englishmen.</p>
