    <p>An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin's head, removing his cap to replace it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife,
    declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good.
    Ahab's hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last
    disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that
    vast height into the sea.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight.</h2>
    <p>The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and
    another ship, most miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed upon her
    broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine
    feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.</p>

    <p>Upon the stranger's shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some few splintered planks, of what had
    once been a whale-boat; but you now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled, half-unhinged,
    and bleaching skeleton of a horse.</p>

    <p>"Hast seen the White Whale?"</p>

    <p>"Look!" replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.</p>

    <p>"Hast killed him?"</p>

    <p>"The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that," answered the other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock
    on the deck, whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.</p>

    <p>"Not forged!" and snatching Perth's levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab held it out, exclaiming&mdash;"Look ye,
    Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these barbs; and I
    swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed
    life!"</p>

    <p>"Then God keep thee, old man&mdash;see'st thou that"&mdash;pointing to the hammock&mdash;"I bury but one of five
    stout men, who were alive only yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only THAT one I bury; the rest were buried before
    they died; you sail upon their tomb." Then turning to his crew&mdash;"Are ye ready there? place the plank then on
    the rail, and lift the body; so, then&mdash;Oh! God"&mdash;advancing towards the hammock with uplifted
    hands&mdash;"may the resurrection and the life&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Brace forward! Up helm!" cried Ahab like lightning to his men.</p>

    <p>But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made
    as it struck the sea; not so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with
    their ghostly baptism.</p>

    <p>As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy hanging at the Pequod's stern came into
    conspicuous relief.</p>

    <p>"Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!" cried a foreboding voice in her wake. "In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad
    burial; ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin!"</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 132. The Symphony.</h2>
    <p>It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all-pervading azure;
    only, the pensive air was transparently pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the robust and man-like sea heaved
    with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson's chest in his sleep.</p>

    <p>Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small, unspeckled birds; these were the gentle
    thoughts of the feminine air; but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed mighty
    leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong, troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine
    sea.</p>

    <p>But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and shadows without; those two seemed one; it
    was only the sex, as it were, that distinguished them.</p>

    <p>Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea; even as
    bride to groom. And at the girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion&mdash;most seen here at the
    Equator&mdash;denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom
    away.</p>

    <p>Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like
    coals, that still glow in the ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting his
    splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl's forehead of heaven.</p>

    <p>Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet
    childhood of air and sky! how oblivious were ye of old Ahab's close-coiled woe! But so have I seen little Miriam and
    Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which
    grew on the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.</p>

    <p>Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank
    and sank to his gaze, the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the lovely aromas in that
    enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that
    winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world, so long cruel&mdash;forbidding&mdash;now
    threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that however
    wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab
    dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop.</p>

    <p>Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side; and he seemed to hear in his own true
    heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch him, or be
    noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood there.</p>

    <p>Ahab turned.</p>

    <p>"Starbuck!"</p>

    <p>"Sir."</p>
