    <p>Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's religion, be it what it may, so long as that person
    does not kill or insult any other person, because that other person don't believe it also. But when a man's religion
    becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an
    uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with
    him.</p>

    <p>And just so I now did with Queequeg. "Queequeg," said I, "get into bed now, and lie and listen to me." I then
    went on, beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various religions
    of the present time, during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged
    ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in
    short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an
    extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish
    about this ridiculous Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;
    and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists
    cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is
    an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias
    nurtured by Ramadans.</p>

    <p>I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so
    that he could take it in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great feast given by his
    father the king, on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock in
    the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.</p>

    <p>"No more, Queequeg," said I, shuddering; "that will do;" for I knew the inferences without his further hinting
    them. I had seen a sailor who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a great
    battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,
    they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and
    with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the victor's compliments to all his friends, just as though
    these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.</p>

    <p>After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the
    first place, he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his own point of
    view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,
    finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did. He looked at me with a
    sort of condescending concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man
    should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.</p>

    <p>At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so
    that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod,
    sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 18. His Mark.</h2>
    <p>As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in
    his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and
    furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced their
    papers.</p>

    <p>"What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?" said I, now jumping on the bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing
    on the wharf.</p>

    <p>"I mean," he replied, "he must show his papers."</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from behind Peleg's, out of the wigwam. "He
    must show that he's converted. Son of darkness," he added, turning to Queequeg, "art thou at present in communion
    with any Christian church?"</p>

    <p>"Why," said I, "he's a member of the first Congregational Church." Here be it said, that many tattooed savages
    sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches.</p>

    <p>"First Congregational Church," cried Bildad, "what! that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman's meeting-house?"
    and so saying, taking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and putting
    them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at
    Queequeg.</p>

    <p>"How long hath he been a member?" he then said, turning to me; "not very long, I rather guess, young man."</p>

    <p>"No," said Peleg, "and he hasn't been baptized right either, or it would have washed some of that devil's blue
    off his face."</p>

    <p>"Do tell, now," cried Bildad, "is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy's meeting? I never saw
    him going there, and I pass it every Lord's day."</p>

    <p>"I don't know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting," said I; "all I know is, that Queequeg here is a
    born member of the First Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is."</p>

    <p>"Young man," said Bildad sternly, "thou art skylarking with me&mdash;explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What
    church dost thee mean? answer me."</p>

    <p>Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. "I mean, sir, the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I,
    and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother's son and soul of us belong; the great
    and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish
    some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in THAT we all join hands."</p>

    <p>"Splice, thou mean'st SPLICE hands," cried Peleg, drawing nearer. "Young man, you'd better ship for a missionary,
    instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy&mdash;why Father Mapple himself
    couldn't beat it, and he's reckoned something. Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell
    Quohog there&mdash;what's that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great anchor, what a harpoon he's got
    there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you
    ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?"</p>
