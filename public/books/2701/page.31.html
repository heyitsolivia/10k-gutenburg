    <p>"Oh! perry dood seat," said Queequeg, "my country way; won't hurt him face."</p>

    <p>"Face!" said I, "call that his face? very benevolent countenance then; but how hard he breathes, he's heaving
    himself; get off, Queequeg, you are heavy, it's grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look, he'll twitch
    you off soon. I wonder he don't wake."</p>

    <p>Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the
    feet. We kept the pipe passing over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him in his
    broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all
    sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for
    ottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and
    lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much better than those
    garden-chairs which are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and desiring
    him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.</p>

    <p>While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet-side
    of it over the sleeper's head.</p>

    <p>"What's that for, Queequeg?"</p>

    <p>"Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!"</p>

    <p>He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe, which, it seemed, had in its two uses both
    brained his foes and soothed his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The strong vapour now
    completely filling the contracted hole, it began to tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then
    seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and rubbed his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Holloa!" he breathed at last, "who be ye smokers?"</p>

    <p>"Shipped men," answered I, "when does she sail?"</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain came aboard last night."</p>

    <p>"What Captain?&mdash;Ahab?"</p>

    <p>"Who but him indeed?"</p>

    <p>I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we heard a noise on deck.</p>

    <p>"Holloa! Starbuck's astir," said the rigger. "He's a lively chief mate, that; good man, and a pious; but all
    alive now, I must turn to." And so saying he went on deck, and we followed.</p>

    <p>It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the
    mates were actively engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board.
    Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.</h2>
    <p>At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship's riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out
    from the wharf, and after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last gift&mdash;a
    night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward&mdash;after all this,
    the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:</p>

    <p>"Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is all ready&mdash;just spoke to
    him&mdash;nothing more to be got from shore, eh? Well, call all hands, then. Muster 'em aft here&mdash;blast
    'em!"</p>

    <p>"No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg," said Bildad, "but away with thee, friend Starbuck,
    and do our bidding."</p>

    <p>How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with
    a high hand on the quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as well as to all appearances
    in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But then,
    the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out
    to sea. Indeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot's; and as he was not yet completely
    recovered&mdash;so they said&mdash;therefore, Captain Ahab stayed below. And all this seemed natural enough;
    especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after
    heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,
    before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.</p>

    <p>But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Peleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most
    of the talking and commanding, and not Bildad.</p>

    <p>"Aft here, ye sons of bachelors," he cried, as the sailors lingered at the main-mast. "Mr. Starbuck, drive'em
    aft."</p>

    <p>"Strike the tent there!"&mdash;was the next order. As I hinted before, this whalebone marquee was never pitched
    except in port; and on board the Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to be the
    next thing to heaving up the anchor.</p>

    <p>"Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!&mdash;jump!"&mdash;was the next command, and the crew sprang for the
    handspikes.</p>

    <p>Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship. And here
    Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots of the
    port&mdash;he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the
    ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft&mdash;Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively
    engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of
    psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble
    Alley, with hearty good will. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane songs
    would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a
    small choice copy of Watts in each seaman's berth.</p>

    <p>Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful
    manner. I almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused on my
    handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such
    a devil for a pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some
    salvation, spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and
    turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate
    vicinity. That was my first kick.</p>
