    <p>"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!" cried Ahab, "thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand!&mdash;Down!
    down all of ye, but one man at the fore. The boats!&mdash;stand by!"</p>

    <p>Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the
    isolated backstays and halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from his perch.</p>

    <p>"Lower away," he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat&mdash;a spare one, rigged the afternoon previous. "Mr.
    Starbuck, the ship is thine&mdash;keep away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!"</p>

    <p>As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned,
    and was now coming for the three crews. Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them he would take
    the whale head-and-head,&mdash;that is, pull straight up to his forehead,&mdash;a not uncommon thing; for when
    within a certain limit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale's sidelong vision. But ere that close
    limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship's three masts to his eye; the White Whale
    churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a
    lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat,
    seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made. But skilfully manoeuvred,
    incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though, at times, but by
    a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.</p>

    <p>But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed and recrossed, and in a thousand ways
    entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the
    devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to
    rally for a more tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more line: and then was rapidly
    hauling and jerking in upon it again&mdash;hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls&mdash;when lo!&mdash;a
    sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks!</p>

    <p>Caught and twisted&mdash;corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons and lances, with all their
    bristling barbs and points, came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat. Only one thing
    could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached within&mdash;through&mdash;and then, without&mdash;the
    rays of steel; dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering the rope
    near the chocks&mdash;dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the
    White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the
    more involved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a
    surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space,
    the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of
    punch.</p>

    <p>While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other
    floating furniture, while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his legs upwards to
    escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old
    man's line&mdash;now parting&mdash;admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could;&mdash;in
    that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils,&mdash;Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards
    Heaven by invisible wires,&mdash;as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his
    broad forehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell
    again&mdash;gunwale downwards&mdash;and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side
    cave.</p>

    <p>The first uprising momentum of the whale&mdash;modifying its direction as he struck the
    surface&mdash;involuntarily launched him along it, to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had
    made; and with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side; and
    whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew
    back, and came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed
    his pleated forehead through the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his leeward way at
    a traveller's methodic pace.</p>

    <p>As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came bearing down to the rescue, and
    dropping a boat, picked up the floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and safely
    landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and
    lances; inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there; but no fatal or even
    serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging
    to his boat's broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous
    day's mishap.</p>

    <p>But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as instead of standing by himself he still
    half-hung upon the shoulder of Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory leg had been
    snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye, Starbuck, 'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he will; and would old Ahab had leaned
    oftener than he has."</p>

    <p>"The ferrule has not stood, sir," said the carpenter, now coming up; "I put good work into that leg."</p>

    <p>"But no bones broken, sir, I hope," said Stubb with true concern.</p>

    <p>"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!&mdash;d'ye see it.&mdash;But even with a broken bone, old Ahab is
    untouched; and I account no living bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one that's lost. Nor white whale,
    nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being. Can any lead touch
    yonder floor, any mast scrape yonder roof?&mdash;Aloft there! which way?"</p>

    <p>"Dead to leeward, sir."</p>

    <p>"Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of the spare boats and rig them&mdash;Mr.
    Starbuck away, and muster the boat's crews."</p>
