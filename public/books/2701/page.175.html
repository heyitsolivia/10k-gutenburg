    <p>Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at
    last when Ahab was sliding by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck's face as he leaned over the
    rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing
    upwards, he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were
    rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in repairing
    them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask,
    busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in the
    broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane
    or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again
    for another flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.</p>

    <p>Whether fagged by the three days' running chase, and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he
    bore; or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White Whale's way now
    began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more; though indeed the whale's last start
    had not been so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him;
    and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became jagged
    and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost every dip.</p>

    <p>"Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull on! 'tis the better rest, the shark's jaw
    than the yielding water."</p>

    <p>"But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!"</p>

    <p>"They will last long enough! pull on!&mdash;But who can tell"&mdash;he muttered&mdash;"whether these sharks swim
    to feast on the whale or on Ahab?&mdash;But pull on! Aye, all alive, now&mdash;we near him. The helm! take the helm!
    let me pass,"&mdash;and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.</p>

    <p>At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with the White Whale's flank, he seemed
    strangely oblivious of its advance&mdash;as the whale sometimes will&mdash;and Ahab was fairly within the smoky
    mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale's spout, curled round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus
    close to him; when, with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the poise, he darted his fierce
    iron, and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked into
    a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a
    hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he
    then clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen&mdash;who foreknew
    not the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for its effects&mdash;these were flung out; but
    so fell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a combing wave,
    hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and
    swimming.</p>

    <p>Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated, instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted
    through the weltering sea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line, and hold it so;
    and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous
    line felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!</p>

    <p>"What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!&mdash;'tis whole again; oars! oars! Burst in upon him!"</p>

    <p>Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at
    bay; but in that evolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing in it the source
    of all his persecutions; bethinking it&mdash;it may be&mdash;a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon
    its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.</p>

    <p>Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. "I grow blind; hands! stretch out before me that I may yet grope my
    way. Is't night?"</p>

    <p>"The whale! The ship!" cried the cringing oarsmen.</p>

    <p>"Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for ever too late, Ahab may slide this last,
    last time upon his mark! I see: the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?"</p>

    <p>But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten
    bow-ends of two planks burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with
    the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.</p>

    <p>Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego's mast-head hammer remained suspended in his hand; and the red
    flag, half-wrapping him as with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own forward-flowing
    heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as
    soon as he.</p>

    <p>"The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of air, now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die,
    if die he must, in a woman's fainting fit. Up helm, I say&mdash;ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is this the end of all
    my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities? Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay!
    Up helm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot
    depart. My God, stand by me now!"</p>

    <p>"Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I
    grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb's own unwinking eye? And
    now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at
    thee, thou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up
    his ghost. For all that, I would yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou grinning
    whale, but there'll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb
    die in his drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death, though;&mdash;cherries! cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for
    one red cherry ere we die!"</p>
