    <p>It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have
    been a flash of honesty in him; or mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously forbade the
    slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient, in the important chief officer of his ship. However it
    was, his orders were executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His Coffin.</h2>
    <p>Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound, and that the leak
    must be further off. So, it being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the slumbers of the
    huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep
    did they go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons, that you almost looked
    next for some mouldy corner-stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted placards, vainly
    warning the infatuated old world from the flood. Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks
    of staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks were hard to get about; and the
    hollow hull echoed under foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea like
    an air-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head. Well was
    it that the Typhoons did not visit them then.</p>

    <p>Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever,
    which brought him nigh to his endless end.</p>

    <p>Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown; dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you
    get to be Captain, the higher you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as harpooneer, must not only
    face all the rage of the living whale, but&mdash;as we have elsewhere seen&mdash;mount his dead back in a rolling
    sea; and finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous
    confinement, resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen, the
    harpooneers are the holders, so called.</p>

    <p>Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should have stooped over the hatchway, and peered
    down upon him there; where, stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that
    dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow
    proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill
    which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after some days' suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill
    of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few long-lingering days, till there seemed but little
    left of him but his frame and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes,
    nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply
    looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die,
    or be weakened. And like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and
    rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of
    this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died.
    For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And the drawing near of
    Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could
    adequately tell. So that&mdash;let us say it again&mdash;no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts
    than those, whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his
    swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest, and the ocean's invisible
    flood-tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven.</p>

    <p>Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself, what he thought of his case was forcibly
    shown by a curious favour he asked. He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was just breaking,
    and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the
    rich war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were
    laid in those same dark canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not unlike the
    custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be
    floated away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond
    all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form the white
    breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock, according to
    the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of
    Nantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes were without
    a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.</p>

    <p>Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg's
    bidding, whatever it might include. There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard, which, upon a long
    previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the
    coffin was recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than taking his rule, he
    forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg's
    measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg's person as he shifted the rule.</p>

    <p>"Ah! poor fellow! he'll have to die now," ejaculated the Long Island sailor.</p>

    <p>Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference, now transferringly measured on
    it the exact length the coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its
    extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to work.</p>
