    <p>Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic
    seas; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires,
    wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of
    house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;&mdash;it is not these things alone which make
    tearless Lima, the strangest, saddest city thou can'st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a higher
    horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the
    cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes
    its own distortions.</p>

    <p>I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in
    exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in
    those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when
    exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality. What I mean by these two statements may
    perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples.</p>

    <p>First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by night he hear the roar of breakers,
    starts to vigilance, and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely similar
    circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky
    whiteness&mdash;as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him, then he feels
    a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in
    vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue
    water is under him again. Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, "Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking
    hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?"</p>

    <p>Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread,
    except, perhaps, in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes, and the
    natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it
    with the backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven
    snow, no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding the scenery of
    the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he,
    shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery, views what seems a
    boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses.</p>

    <p>But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven
    soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael.</p>

    <p>Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont, far removed from all beasts of
    prey&mdash;why is it that upon the sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he cannot
    even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness&mdash;why will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw
    the ground in phrensies of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green
    northern home, so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience
    of former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon?</p>

    <p>No; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world.
    Though thousands of miles from Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison herds are as
    present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.</p>

    <p>Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains; the
    desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that buffalo
    robe to the frightened colt!</p>

    <p>Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints; yet with me,
    as with the colt, somewhere those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed
    in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.</p>

    <p>But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and learned why it appeals with such power to the
    soul; and more strange and far more portentous&mdash;why, as we have seen, it is at once the most meaning symbol of
    spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the Christian's Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent in
    things the most appalling to mankind.</p>

    <p>Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe, and thus
    stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is it,
    that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the
    concrete of all colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide
    landscape of snows&mdash;a colourless, all-colour of atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other
    theory of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues&mdash;every stately or lovely emblazoning&mdash;the
    sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of
    young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only laid on from without;
    so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house
    within; and when we proceed further, and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues,
    the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colourless in itself, and if operating without medium upon
    matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge&mdash;pondering all this, the
    palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and
    colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that
    wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the
    fiery hunt?</p>
