    <p>Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag Harbor, you will come across lively
    sketches of whales and whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies' busks
    wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and other like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous little
    ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of
    them have little boxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the skrimshandering business. But,
    in general, they toil with their jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor, they will
    turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner's fancy.</p>

    <p>Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which God placed him,
    i.e. what is called savagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a savage,
    owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.</p>

    <p>Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours, is his wonderful patience of
    industry. An ancient Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving, is as
    great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon. For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark's tooth,
    that miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has cost steady years of steady
    application.</p>

    <p>As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the same marvellous patience, and with the
    same single shark's tooth, of his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not quite as
    workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as the Greek savage, Achilles's shield; and full of
    barbaric spirit and suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert Durer.</p>

    <p>Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea war-wood, are
    frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers. Some of them are done with much accuracy.</p>

    <p>At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road-side
    door. When the porter is sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales are seldom
    remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed
    there for weather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with
    "HANDS OFF!" you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit.</p>

    <p>In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in
    fantastic groupings upon the plain, you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly
    merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges.</p>

    <p>Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here
    and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the
    undulating ridges. But you must be a thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but if you wish to
    return to such a sight again, you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first
    stand-point, else so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your precise, previous stand-point would
    require a laborious re-discovery; like the Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita, though once high-ruffed
    Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.</p>

    <p>Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens, and
    boats in pursuit of them; as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle
    among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the
    bright points that first defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis,
    and joined the chase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying Fish.</p>

    <p>With a frigate's anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs, would I could mount that whale and
    leap the topmost skies, to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond
    my mortal sight!</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 58. Brit.</h2>
    <p>Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows of brit, the minute, yellow substance,
    upon which the Right Whale largely feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that we seemed to be
    sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat.</p>

    <p>On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the
    Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous
    Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip.</p>

    <p>As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of
    marshy meads; even so these monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving behind them endless
    swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*</p>

    <p>*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the "Brazil Banks" does not bear that name as the Banks of
    Newfoundland do, because of there being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable meadow-like
    appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is
    often chased.</p>

    <p>But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers. Seen from the
    mast-heads, especially when they paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked more like
    lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in the great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a
    distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such, taking them for
    bare, blackened elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species of the
    leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to
    believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life that
    lives in a dog or a horse.</p>
