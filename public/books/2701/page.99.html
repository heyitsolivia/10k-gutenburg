    <p>It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps
    almost as frequent as any. Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated; oftener the boat's bow
    is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body.
    But strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one, when the body has been recovered, not a
    single mark of violence is discernible; the man being stark dead.</p>

    <p>The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried from the ship. Raising a piercing
    shriek&mdash;"The vial! the vial!" Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of the
    whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence; because his credulous disciples believed that
    he had specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy, which any one might have done, and
    so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror to the ship.</p>

    <p>Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him, that the stranger captain could not
    forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which Ahab
    answered&mdash;"Aye." Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and
    vehemently exclaimed, with downward pointed finger&mdash;"Think, think of the blasphemer&mdash;dead, and down
    there!&mdash;beware of the blasphemer's end!"</p>

    <p>Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, "Captain, I have just bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a
    letter for one of thy officers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag."</p>

    <p>Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships, whose delivery to the persons to whom
    they may be addressed, depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans. Thus, most letters
    never reach their mark; and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more.</p>

    <p>Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted,
    green mould, in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death himself might well
    have been the post-boy.</p>

    <p>"Can'st not read it?" cried Ahab. "Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it's but a dim scrawl;&mdash;what's this?" As he
    was studying it out, Starbuck took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to insert
    the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without its coming any closer to the ship.</p>

    <p>Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, "Mr. Har&mdash;yes, Mr. Harry&mdash;(a woman's pinny hand,&mdash;the
    man's wife, I'll wager)&mdash;Aye&mdash;Mr. Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;&mdash;why it's Macey, and he's dead!"</p>

    <p>"Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife," sighed Mayhew; "but let me have it."</p>

    <p>"Nay, keep it thyself," cried Gabriel to Ahab; "thou art soon going that way."</p>

    <p>"Curses throttle thee!" yelled Ahab. "Captain Mayhew, stand by now to receive it"; and taking the fatal missive
    from Starbuck's hands, he caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat. But as he did so,
    the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship's stern; so that, as if by
    magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel's eager hand. He clutched it in an instant, seized the
    boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab's feet. Then
    Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot
    away from the Pequod.</p>

    <p>As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale, many strange things were
    hinted in reference to this wild affair.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.</h2>
    <p>In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is much running backwards and forwards
    among the crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one
    place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors
    the description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground
    in the whale's back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But
    how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my
    particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster's back for the special
    purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale
    till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely
    submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck,
    the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a
    tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume&mdash;a shirt and
    socks&mdash;in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to
    observe him, as will presently be seen.</p>

    <p>Being the savage's bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward),
    it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale's back. You
    have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the ship's steep side, did I hold
    Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong
    strip of canvas belted round his waist.</p>

    <p>It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we proceed further, it must be said that the
    monkey-rope was fast at both ends; fast to Queequeg's broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one. So that
    for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both
    usage and honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake. So, then, an
    elongated Siamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get rid of
    the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.</p>
