    <p>Thus, while in life the great whale's body may have been a real terror to his foes, in his death his ghost
    becomes a powerless panic to a world.</p>

    <p>Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than the Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than
    Doctor Johnson who believe in them.</p>

    <p>It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded.
    Now, the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced whale surgeons very
    much pride themselves: and not without reason.</p>

    <p>Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck; on the contrary, where his head and body
    seem to join, there, in that very place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the surgeon must operate
    from above, some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a
    discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward
    circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without so much as
    getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent,
    interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull. Do you not
    marvel, then, at Stubb's boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?</p>

    <p>When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped. That done, if
    it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a full grown leviathan
    this is impossible; for the sperm whale's head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to
    suspend such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt
    weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers' scales.</p>

    <p>The Pequod's whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was hoisted against the ship's
    side&mdash;about half way out of the sea, so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And
    there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower
    mast-head, and every yard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that blood-dripping head
    hung to the Pequod's waist like the giant Holofernes's from the girdle of Judith.</p>

    <p>When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went below to their dinner. Silence reigned over
    the before tumultuous but now deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was more and
    more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea.</p>

    <p>A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his cabin. Taking a few turns on the
    quarter-deck, he paused to gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took Stubb's long
    spade&mdash;still remaining there after the whale's Decapitation&mdash;and striking it into the lower part of the
    half-suspended mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively
    fixed on this head.</p>

    <p>It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx's in
    the desert. "Speak, thou vast and venerable head," muttered Ahab, "which, though ungarnished with a beard, yet here
    and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all
    divers, thou hast dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams, has moved amid this world's
    foundations. Where unrecorded names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous hold
    this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful water-land, there was
    thy most familiar home. Thou hast been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor's side, where
    sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down. Thou saw'st the locked lovers when leaping from their
    flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed false to
    them. Thou saw'st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper
    midnight of the insatiate maw; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed&mdash;while swift lightnings shivered the
    neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms. O head! thou hast seen
    enough to split the planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!"</p>

    <p>"Sail ho!" cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.</p>

    <p>"Aye? Well, now, that's cheering," cried Ahab, suddenly erecting himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside
    from his brow. "That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man.&mdash;Where away?"</p>

    <p>"Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze to us!</p>

    <p>"Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way, and to my breezelessness bring his breeze!
    O Nature, and O soul of man! how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the smallest atom stirs or
    lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate in mind."</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam's Story.</h2>
    <p>Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than the ship, and soon the Pequod began to
    rock.</p>

    <p>By and by, through the glass the stranger's boats and manned mast-heads proved her a whale-ship. But as she was
    so far to windward, and shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the Pequod could not hope to
    reach her. So the signal was set to see what response would be made.</p>

    <p>Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of the American Whale Fleet have each a
    private signal; all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached, every
    captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even
    at considerable distances and with no small facility.</p>

    <p>The Pequod's signal was at last responded to by the stranger's setting her own; which proved the ship to be the
    Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod's lee, and lowered a boat;
    it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck's order to accommodate the visiting captain,
    the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat's stern in token of that proceeding being entirely
    unnecessary. It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her captain, was
    fearful of infecting the Pequod's company. For, though himself and boat's crew remained untainted, and though his
    ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously
    adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the
    Pequod.</p>
