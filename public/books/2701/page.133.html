    <p>Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and humorously discourse of parlors, sofas,
    carpets, and fine cambrics; propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not to taking tea by
    moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were
    little short of audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and bring us napkins!</p>

    <p>But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent on spying out more whales, which, if
    caught, infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot somewhere. Yes;
    and many is the time, when, after the severest uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing straight
    through for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the
    Line,&mdash;they only step to the deck to carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash, yea,
    and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the
    equatorial try-works; when, on the heel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship, and
    make a spotless dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks,
    are startled by the cry of "There she blows!" and away they fly to fight another whale, and go through the whole
    weary thing again. Oh! my friends, but this is man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we mortals by long
    toilings extracted from this world's vast bulk its small but valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed
    ourselves from its defilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul; hardly is this done,
    when&mdash;THERE SHE BLOWS!&mdash;the ghost is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other world, and go
    through young life's old routine again.</p>

    <p>Oh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise,
    so mild; I sailed with thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage&mdash;and, foolish as I am, taught thee, a green
    simple boy, how to splice a rope!</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 99. The Doubloon.</h2>
    <p>Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck, taking regular turns at either limit, the
    binnacle and mainmast; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that
    sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there
    strangely eyeing the particular object before him. When he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on
    the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose; and
    when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the
    riveted gold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing,
    if not hopefulness.</p>

    <p>But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and
    inscriptions stamped on it, as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac
    way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are
    little worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about
    Boston, to fill up some morass in the Milky Way.</p>

    <p>Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east
    and west, over golden sands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all the
    rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it
    still preserved its Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands,
    and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless
    every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was set apart and sanctified to one
    awe-striking end; and however wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale's
    talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and
    whether he would ever live to spend it.</p>

    <p>Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and tropic token-pieces. Here palms,
    alpacas, and volcanoes; sun's disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving, are in luxuriant
    profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by
    passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.</p>

    <p>It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of these things. On its round border it
    bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the
    world, and beneath the great equator, and named after it; and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning
    clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes' summits; from one a flame; a
    tower on another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the
    signs all marked with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra.</p>

    <p>Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now pausing.</p>

    <p>"There's something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all other grand and lofty things; look
    here,&mdash;three peaks as proud as Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the
    courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but the
    image of the rounder globe, which, like a magician's glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own
    mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself.
    Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but
    six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes,
    't is fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be it, then! Here's stout stuff for woe to work on. So
    be it, then."</p>
