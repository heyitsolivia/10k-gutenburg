    <p>"In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that's all. Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast
    been going. What a lovely day again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the angels, and this
    morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world. Here's food for
    thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; THAT'S tingling enough for
    mortal man! to think's audacity. God only has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and
    a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for that. And yet, I've sometimes thought
    my brain was very calm&mdash;frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turned to
    ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it's
    like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius
    lava. How the wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they
    cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals,
    and ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!&mdash;it's tainted. Were I
    the wind, I'd blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. I'd crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink there. And
    yet, 'tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest
    blow. Run tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not
    stand to receive a single blow. Even Ahab is a braver thing&mdash;a nobler thing than THAT. Would now the wind but
    had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only
    bodiless as objects, not as agents. There's a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious difference! And
    yet, I say again, and swear it now, that there's something all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm Trade
    Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer
    not from their mark, however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the
    land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the eternal Poles! these same Trades that so
    directly blow my good ship on; these Trades, or something like them&mdash;something so unchangeable, and full as
    strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there! What d'ye see?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing, sir."</p>

    <p>"Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun! Aye, aye, it must be so. I've oversailed
    him. How, got the start? Aye, he's chasing ME now; not I, HIM&mdash;that's bad; I might have known it, too. Fool!
    the lines&mdash;the harpoons he's towing. Aye, aye, I have run him by last night. About! about! Come down, all of
    ye, but the regular look outs! Man the braces!"</p>

    <p>Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod's quarter, so that now being pointed in the
    reverse direction, the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white
    wake.</p>

    <p>"Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw," murmured Starbuck to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled
    main-brace upon the rail. "God keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my flesh.
    I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!"</p>

    <p>"Stand by to sway me up!" cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket. "We should meet him soon."</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye, sir," and straightway Starbuck did Ahab's bidding, and once more Ahab swung on high.</p>

    <p>A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense. But at
    last, some three points off the weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three mast-heads
    three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.</p>

    <p>"Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck there!&mdash;brace sharper up; crowd her
    into the wind's eye. He's too far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that helmsman with a
    top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea;
    there's time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw
    it, a boy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket! The same!&mdash;the same!&mdash;the same to Noah as to me. There's a
    soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead somewhere&mdash;to something else than common land,
    more palmy than the palms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then; the better if the
    bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old mast-head! What's this?&mdash;green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped
    cracks. No such green weather stains on Ahab's head! There's the difference now between man's old age and matter's.
    But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus a leg,
    that's all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way. I can't compare with it; and I've
    known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers. What's
    that he said? he should still go before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at the
    bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all night I've been sailing from him, wherever he
    did sink to. Aye, aye, like many more thou told'st direful truth as touching thyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy
    shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head&mdash;keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I'm gone. We'll talk to-morrow,
    nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail."</p>

    <p>He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck.</p>

    <p>In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop's stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of
    the descent, he waved to the mate,&mdash;who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck&mdash;and bade him pause.</p>

    <p>"Starbuck!"</p>

    <p>"Sir?"</p>

    <p>"For the third time my soul's ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck."</p>

    <p>"Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so."</p>

    <p>"Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing, Starbuck!"</p>

    <p>"Truth, sir: saddest truth."</p>

    <p>"Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the flood;&mdash;and I feel now like a billow
    that's all one crested comb, Starbuck. I am old;&mdash;shake hands with me, man."</p>
