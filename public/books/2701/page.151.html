    <p>"Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!" deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron
    scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood.</p>

    <p>Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab
    fitted the end to the socket of the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of it taken to
    the windlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string,
    then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, "Good! and now for the seizings."</p>

    <p>At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the
    socket of the harpoon; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope was traced
    half-way along the pole's length, and firmly secured so, with intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and
    rope&mdash;like the Three Fates&mdash;remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon; the sound
    of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his
    cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was heard. Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but
    unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship, and
    mocked it!</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 114. The Gilder.</h2>
    <p>Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in
    the fishery. Often, in mild, pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on the stretch, they
    were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty
    or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small success for their pains.</p>

    <p>At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as
    a birch canoe; and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone cats they purr against
    the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the
    ocean's skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and would not willingly remember, that this velvet
    paw but conceals a remorseless fang.</p>

    <p>These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a certain filial, confident, land-like feeling
    towards the sea; that he regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her
    masts, seems struggling forward, not through high rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as
    when the western emigrants' horses only show their erected ears, while their hidden bodies widely wade through the
    amazing verdure.</p>

    <p>The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these there steals the hush, the hum; you almost
    swear that play-wearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when the flowers of the
    woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting,
    interpenetrate, and form one seamless whole.</p>

    <p>Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these
    secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them prove but
    tarnishing.</p>

    <p>Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in ye,&mdash;though long parched by the dead
    drought of the earthy life,&mdash;in ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some few
    fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them. Would to God these blessed calms would last. But
    the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm.
    There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last
    one pause:&mdash;through infancy's unconscious spell, boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence' doubt (the common
    doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's pondering repose of If. But once gone through,
    we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we
    unmoor no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling's
    father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our
    paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.</p>

    <p>And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat's side into that same golden sea, Starbuck lowly
    murmured:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride's eye!&mdash;Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered
    sharks, and thy kidnapping cannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep down and do
    believe."</p>

    <p>And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same golden light:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that he has always been jolly!"</p>

    <p>And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down before the wind, some few weeks after
    Ahab's harpoon had been welded.</p>

    <p>It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her last cask of oil, and bolted down her
    bursting hatches; and now, in glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, sailing round
    among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous to pointing her prow for home.</p>

    <p>The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats; from the stern, a
    whale-boat was suspended, bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last
    whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side.
    Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her top-mast
    cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen
    lamp.</p>
