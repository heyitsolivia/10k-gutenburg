    <p>Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name; for the pots there were always
    boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for
    fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a
    polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin.
    There was a fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening to take
    a stroll along the beach among some fishermen's boats, I saw Hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and
    marching along the sand with each foot in a cod's decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.</p>

    <p>Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as
    Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she
    allowed no harpoon in her chambers. "Why not?" said I; "every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon&mdash;but why
    not?" "Because it's dangerous," says she. "Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort'nt v'y'ge of his, when he
    was gone four years and a half, with only three barrels of <em>ile</em>, was found dead in my first floor back, with
    his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night.
    So, Mr. Queequeg" (for she had learned his name), "I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you till
    morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?"</p>

    <p>"Both," says I; "and let's have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety."</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 16. The Ship.</h2>
    <p>In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to
    understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo&mdash;the name of his black little god&mdash;and Yojo had
    told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among
    the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined
    that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order
    to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for
    all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the
    present irrespective of Queequeg.</p>

    <p>I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo's
    judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of
    god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.</p>

    <p>Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at
    all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our
    fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and
    accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should
    quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little
    bedroom&mdash;for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer
    with Queequeg and Yojo that day; HOW it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several
    times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles&mdash;leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk
    pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much
    prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years'
    voyages&mdash;The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. DEVIL-DAM, I do not know the origin of; TIT-BIT is
    obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now
    extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and
    finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for
    us.</p>

    <p>You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;&mdash;square-toed luggers; mountainous
    Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as
    this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned
    claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old
    hull's complexion was darkened like a French grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable
    bows looked bearded. Her masts&mdash;cut somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost
    overboard in a gale&mdash;her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient
    decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But
    to all these her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for
    more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another
    vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,&mdash;this old Peleg,
    during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a
    quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or
    bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.
    She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All
    round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm
    whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base
    blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend
    helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw
    of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds
    back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are
    touched with that.</p>
