    <p>The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek
    on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it,
    the polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.</p>

    <p>"Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!"</p>

    <p>Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with
    such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their
    clothes in their hands.</p>

    <p>"What d'ye see?" cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.</p>

    <p>"Nothing, nothing sir!" was the sound hailing down in reply.</p>

    <p>"T'gallant sails!&mdash;stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!"</p>

    <p>All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in
    a few moments they were hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and while peering ahead
    through the horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the air.
    "There she blows!&mdash;there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!"</p>

    <p>Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the
    rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final perch, some feet
    above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the
    Indian's head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel. From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead,
    at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air. To
    the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and
    Indian Oceans.</p>

    <p>"And did none of ye see it before?" cried Ahab, hailing the perched men all around him.</p>

    <p>"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I cried out," said Tashtego.</p>

    <p>"Not the same instant; not the same&mdash;no, the doubloon is mine, Fate reserved the doubloon for me. I only;
    none of ye could have raised the White Whale first. There she blows!&mdash;there she blows!&mdash;there she blows!
    There again!&mdash;there again!" he cried, in long-drawn, lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual
    prolongings of the whale's visible jets. "He's going to sound! In stunsails! Down top-gallant-sails! Stand by three
    boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man,
    steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr.
    Starbuck; lower, lower,&mdash;quick, quicker!" and he slid through the air to the deck.</p>

    <p>"He is heading straight to leeward, sir," cried Stubb, "right away from us; cannot have seen the ship yet."</p>

    <p>"Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!&mdash;brace up! Shiver her!&mdash;shiver her!&mdash;So;
    well that! Boats, boats!"</p>

    <p>Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails set&mdash;all the paddles plying; with
    rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah's sunken
    eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.</p>

    <p>Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea; but only slowly they neared the foe. As
    they neared him, the ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a noon-meadow, so
    serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire
    dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing, and continually set in a
    revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head
    beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky
    forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed
    over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But
    these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their
    fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of
    a recent lance projected from the white whale's back; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering,
    and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail
    feathers streaming like pennons.</p>

    <p>A gentle joyousness&mdash;a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested the gliding whale. Not the white
    bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering eyes sideways
    intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove,
    not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam.</p>

    <p>On each soft side&mdash;coincident with the parted swell, that but once leaving him, then flowed so wide
    away&mdash;on each bright side, the whale shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who
    namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured to assail it; but had fatally found that
    quietude but the vesture of tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all who for the first
    time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed before.</p>

    <p>And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended
    by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk,
    entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw. But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for
    an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia's Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his
    bannered flukes in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hoveringly halting, and
    dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.</p>

    <p>With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting
    Moby Dick's reappearance.</p>

    <p>"An hour," said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he gazed beyond the whale's place, towards the dim
    blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed whirling round
    in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.</p>
