    <p>"Avast!" cried Ahab; "let's have fair play here, though we be the weaker side. Yet I'll contribute to raise rods
    on the Himmalehs and Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let them be, sir."</p>

    <p>"Look aloft!" cried Starbuck. "The corpusants! the corpusants!"</p>

    <p>All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three
    tapering white flames, each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like three gigantic
    wax tapers before an altar.</p>

    <p>"Blast the boat! let it go!" cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft,
    so that its gunwale violently jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. "Blast it!"&mdash;but slipping backward
    on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and immediately shifting his tone he cried&mdash;"The corpusants
    have mercy on us all!"</p>

    <p>To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of the calm, and in the teeth of the
    tempest; they will imprecate curses from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething sea; but in
    all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when God's burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His
    "Mene, Mene, Tekel Upharsin" has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.</p>

    <p>While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster
    stood on the forecastle, all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away constellation of
    stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and
    seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth,
    which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by the preternatural light,
    Queequeg's tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his body.</p>

    <p>The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks
    were wrapped in a pall. A moment or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It was Stubb.
    "What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same in the song."</p>

    <p>"No, no, it wasn't; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I hope they will, still. But do they only
    have mercy on long faces?&mdash;have they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck&mdash;but it's too dark
    to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a
    hold that is going to be chock a' block with sperm-oil, d'ye see; and so, all that sperm will work up into the
    masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles&mdash;that's the good
    promise we saw."</p>

    <p>At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb's face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he
    cried: "See! see!" and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in
    their pallor.</p>

    <p>"The corpusants have mercy on us all," cried Stubb, again.</p>

    <p>At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame, the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab's front,
    but with his head bowed away from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where they had just
    been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung
    pendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted attitudes, like the
    standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all their eyes
    upcast.</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye, men!" cried Ahab. "Look up at it; mark it well; the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale!
    Hand me those mainmast links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it; blood against fire!
    So."</p>

    <p>Then turning&mdash;the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot upon the Parsee; and with fixed
    upward eye, and high-flung right arm, he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.</p>

    <p>"Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship, till in the sacramental
    act so burned by thee, that to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know that
    thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind; and e'en for hate thou canst but
    kill; and all are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless, placeless power; but to the last
    gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of the personified
    impersonal, a personality stands here. Though but a point at best; whencesoe'er I came; wheresoe'er I go; yet while
    I earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe.
    Come in thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere supernal power;
    and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds, there's that in here that still remains indifferent. Oh,
    thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee."</p>

    <p>[SUDDEN, REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP LENGTHWISE TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT; AHAB,
    WITH THE REST, CLOSES HIS EYES, HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM.]</p>

    <p>"I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung from me; nor do I now drop these links.
    Thou canst blind; but I can then grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the homage of these poor
    eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache;
    my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk
    to thee. Light though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of light, leaping out of
    thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my
    genealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her?
    There lies my puzzle; but thine is greater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself unbegotten;
    certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of
    thyself, oh, thou omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom all thy
    eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see
    it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated
    grief. Here again with haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with
    thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly I worship thee!"</p>
