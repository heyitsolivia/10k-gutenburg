    <p>The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere the boats were down, majestically
    turning, he swam away to the leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he swam,
    that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man
    must speak but in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently
    paddled along; the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the
    monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed
    up.</p>

    <p>"There go flukes!" was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by Stubb's producing his match and igniting
    his pipe, for now a respite was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale rose again,
    and being now in advance of the smoker's boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon
    the honour of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers. All
    silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play. And
    still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the assault.</p>

    <p>Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy, he was going "head out"; that part
    obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he brewed.*</p>

    <p>*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whale's
    enormous head consists. Though apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him. So that
    with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the
    breadth of the upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part,
    that by obliquely elevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish
    galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.</p>

    <p>"Start her, start her, my men! Don't hurry yourselves; take plenty of time&mdash;but start her; start her like
    thunder-claps, that's all," cried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. "Start her, now; give 'em the long
    and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy&mdash;start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool&mdash;cucumbers
    is the word&mdash;easy, easy&mdash;only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the buried dead
    perpendicular out of their graves, boys&mdash;that's all. Start her!"</p>

    <p>"Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!" screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in
    the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian
    gave.</p>

    <p>But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. "Kee-hee! Kee-hee!" yelled Daggoo, straining forwards
    and backwards on his seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.</p>

    <p>"Ka-la! Koo-loo!" howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of Grenadier's steak. And thus with
    oars and yells the keels cut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his men to
    the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the
    welcome cry was heard&mdash;"Stand up, Tashtego!&mdash;give it to him!" The harpoon was hurled. "Stern all!" The
    oarsmen backed water; the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. It was the
    magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence,
    by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from
    his pipe. As the line passed round and round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it
    blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb's hands, from which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted
    canvas sometimes worn at these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy's sharp two-edged sword
    by the blade, and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch.</p>

    <p>"Wet the line! wet the line!" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat,
    dashed sea-water into it.* More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now flew
    through the boiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego here changed places&mdash;stem for stern&mdash;a
    staggering business truly in that rocking commotion.</p>

    <p>*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop
    was used to dash the running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart for that
    purpose. Your hat, however, is the most convenient.</p>

    <p>From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat, and from its now being more
    tight than a harpstring, you would have thought the craft had two keels&mdash;one cleaving the water, the other the
    air&mdash;as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once. A continual cascade played at the bows; a
    ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a little finger, the
    vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and
    main clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar
    crouching almost double, in order to bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as
    they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight.</p>

    <p>"Haul in&mdash;haul in!" cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round towards the whale, all hands began pulling
    the boat up to him, while yet the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly planting his
    knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately
    sterning out of the way of the whale's horrible wallow, and then ranging up for another fling.</p>

    <p>The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill. His tormented body rolled not in
    brine but in blood, which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing upon this
    crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every face, so that they all glowed to each other like red
    men. And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and
    vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked lance
    (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then
    again and again sent it into the whale.</p>
