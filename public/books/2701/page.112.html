    <p>What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop
    was put to further discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea, owing to the
    body's immensely increasing tendency to sink. However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to
    the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship would have been capsized, if still
    persisting in locking arms with the body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such was the
    immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to
    cast them off. Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking
    up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and
    cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to
    bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled
    that the submerged ends could not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to
    the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over.</p>

    <p>"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?" cried Stubb to the body, "don't be in such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder,
    men, we must do something or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run one of ye
    for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains."</p>

    <p>"Knife? Aye, aye," cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and
    steel to iron, began slashing at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were given, when the
    exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase
    sank.</p>

    <p>Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any
    fisherman yet adequately accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its side or
    belly considerably elevated above the surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and
    broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with
    some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking, consequent
    upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling
    with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about
    them; even these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.</p>

    <p>Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species. Where one
    of that sort go down, twenty Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small
    degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a
    ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances where, after the lapse of many
    hours or several days, the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is obvious.
    Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle
    ship could hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a
    Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone
    down, they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.</p>

    <p>It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the Pequod's mast-heads, announcing that
    the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back, belonging to the
    species of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back's spout is
    so similar to the Sperm Whale's, that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it. And consequently Derick
    and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail, made after her
    four young keels, and thus they all disappeared far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.</p>

    <p>Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 82. The Honour and Glory of Whaling.</h2>
    <p>There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true method.</p>

    <p>The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up to the very spring-head of it so much the
    more am I impressed with its great honourableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many great demi-gods
    and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the
    reflection that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.</p>

    <p>The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to the eternal honour of our calling be it
    said, that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those were the
    knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms to succor the distressed, and not to fill men's
    lamp-feeders. Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a
    king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the
    prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered and married the maid. It was an
    admirable artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan
    was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on
    the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the
    city's legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew. When the
    Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively
    important in this story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.</p>

    <p>Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda&mdash;indeed, by some supposed to be indirectly derived from
    it&mdash;is that famous story of St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in
    many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and often stand for each other. "Thou art as
    a lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the sea," saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some
    versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St.
    George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep.
    Any man may kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to a
    whale.</p>
