    <p>For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded White Whale had haunted those
    uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a
    few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given
    battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were
    sprinkled over the entire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary
    latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling
    sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home;
    all these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole world-wide
    whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several
    vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of
    uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped
    them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other than
    Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great
    ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave
    battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,
    more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause. In that way,
    mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.</p>

    <p>And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance caught sight of him; in the beginning of
    the thing they had every one of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other whale of
    that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these assaults&mdash;not restricted to sprained wrists and
    ankles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations&mdash;but fatal to the last degree of fatality; those repeated
    disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake
    the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had eventually come.</p>

    <p>Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more horrify the true histories of these
    deadly encounters. For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible
    events,&mdash;as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that of terra
    firma, wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to. And as the sea surpasses the
    land in this matter, so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and
    fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that
    ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the most
    directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye
    its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed
    a thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable
    beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman
    is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.</p>

    <p>No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces, the outblown
    rumors of the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and half-formed
    foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from
    anything that visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that few who by those
    rumors, at least, had heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his
    jaw.</p>

    <p>But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work. Not even at the present day has the
    original prestige of the Sperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died out
    of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous
    enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would perhaps&mdash;either from professional
    inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty of
    whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely
    encountered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster
    primitively pursued in the North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest
    and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm
    Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.</p>

    <p>And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it; we find
    some book naturalists&mdash;Olassen and Povelson&mdash;declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to
    every other creature in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human
    blood. Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier's, were these or almost similar impressions effaced. For in his
    Natural History, the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are "struck
    with the most lively terrors," and "often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with
    such violence as to cause instantaneous death." And however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such
    reports as these; yet in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious
    belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.</p>

    <p>So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of the fishermen recalled, in reference to
    Moby Dick, the earlier days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right
    whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans
    might be hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal
    man. That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are some
    remarkable documents that may be consulted.</p>
