    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.</h2>
    <p>Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.</p>

    <p>"Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man's ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with
    it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab
    seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask&mdash;you
    know how curious all dreams are&mdash;through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to
    myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab. 'Why,' thinks I, 'what's the row? It's
    not a real leg, only a false leg.' And there's a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump. That's
    what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living
    member&mdash;that makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was
    stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid&mdash;so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I
    say, I was thinking to myself, 'what's his leg now, but a cane&mdash;a whalebone cane. Yes,' thinks I, 'it was only
    a playful cudgelling&mdash;in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me&mdash;not a base kick. Besides,' thinks I,
    'look at it once; why, the end of it&mdash;the foot part&mdash;what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad
    footed farmer kicked me, THERE'S a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a point only.' But now
    comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old
    merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round. 'What are you 'bout?' says he. Slid!
    man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. 'What am I about?' says I
    at last. 'And what business is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do YOU want a kick?' By the lord,
    Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed
    he had for a clout&mdash;what do you think, I saw?&mdash;why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of
    marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, 'I guess I won't kick you, old fellow.' 'Wise Stubb,'
    said he, 'wise Stubb;' and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag.
    Seeing he wasn't going to stop saying over his 'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,' I thought I might as well fall to kicking
    the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, 'Stop that kicking!' 'Halloa,'
    says I, 'what's the matter now, old fellow?' 'Look ye here,' says he; 'let's argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked
    ye, didn't he?' 'Yes, he did,' says I&mdash;'right HERE it was.' 'Very good,' says he&mdash;'he used his ivory leg,
    didn't he?' 'Yes, he did,' says I. 'Well then,' says he, 'wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn't he kick
    with right good will? it wasn't a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you were kicked by a great man,
    and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It's an honour; I consider it an honour. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England
    the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made garter-knights of; but, be YOUR boast,
    Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; BE kicked by him; account his
    kicks honours; and on no account kick back; for you can't help yourself, wise Stubb. Don't you see that pyramid?'
    With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the air. I snored; rolled
    over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.'"</p>

    <p>"May be; may be. But it's made a wise man of me, Flask. D'ye see Ahab standing there, sideways looking over the
    stern? Well, the best thing you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him, whatever he says.
    Halloa! What's that he shouts? Hark!"</p>

    <p>"Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!</p>

    <p>"If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!</p>

    <p>"What do you think of that now, Flask? ain't there a small drop of something queer about that, eh? A white
    whale&mdash;did ye mark that, man? Look ye&mdash;there's something special in the wind. Stand by for it, Flask. Ahab
    has that that's bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this way."</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 32. Cetology.</h2>
    <p>Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harbourless immensities.
    Ere that come to pass; ere the Pequod's weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan; at
    the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the
    more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow.</p>

    <p>It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that I would now fain put before you. Yet is
    it no easy task. The classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here essayed. Listen to what the
    best and latest authorities have laid down.</p>

    <p>"No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology," says Captain Scoresby, A.D.
    1820.</p>

    <p>"It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the
    cetacea into groups and families.... Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal" (sperm whale), says
    Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.</p>

    <p>"Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters." "Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the
    cetacea." "A field strewn with thorns." "All these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists."</p>

    <p>Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy.
    Nevertheless, though of real knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some small
    degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and
    seamen, who have at large or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:&mdash;The Authors of the Bible;
    Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi;
    Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen;
    Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to
    what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts will show.</p>
