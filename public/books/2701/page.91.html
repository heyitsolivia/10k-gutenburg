    <p>Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling,
    sharp-edged terror, skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines, or cutting them, and
    making a prodigious sensation in all directions. Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale
    is fairly captured and a corpse.</p>

    <p>Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong, active, and knowing
    whale; when owing to these qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious
    enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is
    supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery.
    All these particulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several most important,
    however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be painted.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 64. Stubb's Supper.</h2>
    <p>Stubb's whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we
    commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men with our thirty-six
    arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse
    in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of
    the enormousness of the mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever they call it, in China,
    four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this
    grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead in bulk.</p>

    <p>Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod's main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing
    nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a
    moment, he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his
    way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until morning.</p>

    <p>Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had evinced his customary activity, to call it so;
    yet now that the creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed working in him; as
    if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand other whales
    were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have
    thought from the sound on the Pequod's decks, that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy
    chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking links, the
    vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the
    whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel's and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured
    the spars and rigging aloft, the two&mdash;ship and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one
    reclines while the other remains standing.*</p>

    <p>*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the
    whale when moored alongside, is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is relatively
    heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the
    surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put the chain round it. But this
    difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and a
    weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit management the wooden float is made to
    rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit;
    and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of
    junction with its broad flukes or lobes.</p>

    <p>If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed
    with conquest, betrayed an unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the
    staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs. One
    small, helping cause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he
    was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.</p>

    <p>"A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut me one from his small!"</p>

    <p>Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general thing, and according to the great
    military maxim, make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds of the
    voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of
    the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.</p>

    <p>About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to
    his spermaceti supper at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on
    whale's flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks,
    swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness. The few sleepers below in their bunks were
    often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the sleepers' hearts.
    Peering over the side you could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and
    turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head.
    This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable surface, they
    contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all things. The mark
    they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a
    screw.</p>
