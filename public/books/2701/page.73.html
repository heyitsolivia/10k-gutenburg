    <p>Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoto, as called of yore; for long allured by the perfidious
    silences that before had attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty beings
    transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store,
    or beat that black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain of
    feathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be descried.</p>

    <p>During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the
    drenched and dangerous deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates. In
    tempestuous times like these, after everything above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but
    passively to await the issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg
    inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would stand
    gazing dead to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes
    together. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke
    over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to guard against the leaping waves,
    each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened belt.
    Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on
    through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness of humanity before the
    shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the
    blast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock. Never could
    Starbuck forget the old man's aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he
    saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm
    from which he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the table
    beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of. His lantern
    swung from his tightly clenched hand. Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes
    were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling.*</p>

    <p>*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the compass at the helm, the Captain, while
    below, can inform himself of the course of the ship.</p>

    <p>Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy
    purpose.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 52. The Albatross.</h2>
    <p>South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed
    ahead, the Goney (Albatross) by name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head, I had a
    good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries&mdash;a whaler at sea, and long absent
    from home.</p>

    <p>As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her
    sides, this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all her spars and her rigging
    were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it
    was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn
    and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to the
    mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we
    six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one ship to
    those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our
    own look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.</p>

    <p>"Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?"</p>

    <p>But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth,
    it somehow fell from his hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make himself heard
    without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of
    the Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale's
    name to another ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the
    stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But taking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his
    trumpet, and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home, he loudly
    hailed&mdash;"Ahoy there! This is the Pequod, bound round the world! Tell them to address all future letters to the
    Pacific ocean! and this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address them to&mdash;"</p>

    <p>At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then, in accordance with their singular ways,
    shoals of small harmless fish, that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side, darted away with
    what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger's flanks. Though in the course of
    his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest
    trifles capriciously carry meanings.</p>

    <p>"Swim away from me, do ye?" murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water. There seemed but little in the words, but
    the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But turning to the
    steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion
    voice,&mdash;"Up helm! Keep her off round the world!"</p>

    <p>Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings; but whereto does all that
    circumnavigation conduct? Only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that we
    left behind secure, were all the time before us.</p>
