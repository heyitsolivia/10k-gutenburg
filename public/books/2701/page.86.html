    <p>Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do
    those of the shore. For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind
    in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties,
    where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the
    dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.</p>

    <p>But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions
    unspeakably unsocial and repelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that Columbus
    sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most
    terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of
    those who have gone upon the waters; though but a moment's consideration will teach, that however baby man may brag
    of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering future, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever
    and for ever, to the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize the stateliest, stiffest
    frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense of
    the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.</p>

    <p>The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without
    leaving so much as a widow. That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year.
    Yea, foolish mortals, Noah's flood is not yet subsided; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers.</p>

    <p>Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other? Preternatural
    terrors rested upon the Hebrews, when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed
    them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships
    and crews.</p>

    <p>But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is also a fiend to its own off-spring;
    worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a
    savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against
    the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No mercy, no power but its own
    controls it. Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the
    globe.</p>

    <p>Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water, unapparent for the most
    part, and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and
    beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider,
    once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war
    since the world began.</p>

    <p>Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile earth; consider them both, the sea and
    the land; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean surrounds the
    verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the
    horrors of the half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle, thou canst never return!</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 59. Squid.</h2>
    <p>Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her way north-eastward towards the island of
    Java; a gentle air impelling her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly
    waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a plain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the
    lonely, alluring jet would be seen.</p>

    <p>But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea, however unattended
    with any stagnant calm; when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them,
    enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of
    the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.</p>

    <p>In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and higher, and disentangling itself from the
    azure, at last gleamed before our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening for a moment, as
    slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose, and silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this
    Moby Dick? thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that
    startled every man from his nod, the negro yelled out&mdash;"There! there again! there she breaches! right ahead!
    The White Whale, the White Whale!"</p>

    <p>Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the bees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in
    the sultry sun, Ahab stood on the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to
    the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of
    Daggoo.</p>

    <p>Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was
    now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued;
    however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he
    distinctly perceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering.</p>

    <p>The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab's in advance, and all swiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it
    went down, and while, with oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot where it sank,
    once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most
    wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length
    and breadth, of a glancing cream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms radiating from its centre,
    and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach. No
    perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on
    the billows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.</p>
