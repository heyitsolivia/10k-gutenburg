    <p>"Well," said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; "I shall now go back to the subject of this steak. In the
    first place, how old are you, cook?"</p>

    <p>"What dat do wid de 'teak," said the old black, testily.</p>

    <p>"Silence! How old are you, cook?"</p>

    <p>"'Bout ninety, dey say," he gloomily muttered.</p>

    <p>"And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook, and don't know yet how to cook a
    whale-steak?" rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the
    question. "Where were you born, cook?"</p>

    <p>"'Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin' ober de Roanoke."</p>

    <p>"Born in a ferry-boat! That's queer, too. But I want to know what country you were born in, cook!"</p>

    <p>"Didn't I say de Roanoke country?" he cried sharply.</p>

    <p>"No, you didn't, cook; but I'll tell you what I'm coming to, cook. You must go home and be born over again; you
    don't know how to cook a whale-steak yet."</p>

    <p>"Bress my soul, if I cook noder one," he growled, angrily, turning round to depart.</p>

    <p>"Come back here, cook;&mdash;here, hand me those tongs;&mdash;now take that bit of steak there, and tell me if
    you think that steak cooked as it should be? Take it, I say"&mdash;holding the tongs towards him&mdash;"take it, and
    taste it."</p>

    <p>Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro muttered, "Best cooked 'teak I eber taste;
    joosy, berry joosy."</p>

    <p>"Cook," said Stubb, squaring himself once more; "do you belong to the church?"</p>

    <p>"Passed one once in Cape-Down," said the old man sullenly.</p>

    <p>"And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town, where you doubtless overheard a holy parson
    addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here, and tell me such a
    dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?" said Stubb. "Where do you expect to go to, cook?"</p>

    <p>"Go to bed berry soon," he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.</p>

    <p>"Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It's an awful question. Now what's your answer?"</p>

    <p>"When dis old brack man dies," said the negro slowly, changing his whole air and demeanor, "he hisself won't go
    nowhere; but some bressed angel will come and fetch him."</p>

    <p>"Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And fetch him where?"</p>

    <p>"Up dere," said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and keeping it there very solemnly.</p>

    <p>"So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when you are dead? But don't you know the higher
    you climb, the colder it gets? Main-top, eh?"</p>

    <p>"Didn't say dat t'all," said Fleece, again in the sulks.</p>

    <p>"You said up there, didn't you? and now look yourself, and see where your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you
    expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber's hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don't get there,
    except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It's a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it's no go.
    But none of us are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye hear? Hold your hat in one hand,
    and clap t'other a'top of your heart, when I'm giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?&mdash;that's
    your gizzard! Aloft! aloft!&mdash;that's it&mdash;now you have it. Hold it there now, and pay attention."</p>

    <p>"All 'dention," said the old black, with both hands placed as desired, vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if
    to get both ears in front at one and the same time.</p>

    <p>"Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad, that I have put it out of sight as soon as
    possible; you see that, don't you? Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for my private table
    here, the capstan, I'll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show
    a live coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d'ye hear? And now to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the
    fish, be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends of the flukes, have
    them soused, cook. There, now ye may go."</p>

    <p>But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.</p>

    <p>"Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch. D'ye hear? away you sail, then.&mdash;Halloa!
    stop! make a bow before you go.&mdash;Avast heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast&mdash;don't forget."</p>

    <p>"Wish, by gor! whale eat him, 'stead of him eat whale. I'm bressed if he ain't more of shark dan Massa Shark
    hisself," muttered the old man, limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish.</h2>
    <p>That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and, like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as
    you may say; this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of
    it.</p>

    <p>It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in
    France, and commanded large prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth's time, a certain cook of the court obtained a
    handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a
    species of whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The meat is made into balls about the
    size of billiard balls, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls. The old
    monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.</p>

    <p>The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish, were there
    not so much of him; but when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it takes away your
    appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not
    so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda,
    one of their most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly juicy and
    nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a
    whaling vessel&mdash;that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been
    left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called "fritters"; which,
    indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives'
    dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly
    keep his hands off.</p>
