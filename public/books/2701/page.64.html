    <p>Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power;
    but I have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness, they have
    significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being
    facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt.</p>

    <p>But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own.
    That point is this: The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously malicious, as
    with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale HAS
    done it.</p>

    <p>First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day
    she saw spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales were
    wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down
    upon the ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than "ten minutes" she
    settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of
    the crew reached the land in their boats. Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the
    Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the
    second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since. At this day
    Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of
    the tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all this within a few
    miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*</p>

    <p>*The following are extracts from Chace's narrative: "Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was
    anything but chance which directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short interval
    between them, both of which, according to their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made
    ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock; to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which
    he made were necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He came directly
    from the shoal which we had just before entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as if fired
    with revenge for their sufferings." Again: "At all events, the whole circumstances taken together, all happening
    before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part
    of the whale (many of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my
    opinion."</p>

    <p>Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a black night in an open boat, when almost
    despairing of reaching any hospitable shore. "The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the fears of being
    swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful
    contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought; the dismal looking wreck, and THE HORRID ASPECT AND
    REVENGE OF THE WHALE, wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance."</p>

    <p>In another place&mdash;p. 45,&mdash;he speaks of "THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL ATTACK OF THE ANIMAL."</p>

    <p>Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset,
    but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter, though from the whale hunters I
    have now and then heard casual allusions to it.</p>

    <p>Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J&mdash;-, then commanding an American sloop-of-war of the
    first class, happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of
    Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the
    amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily denied for example, that
    any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but
    there is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was
    stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments' confidential business with him. That business
    consisted in fetching the Commodore's craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight for the
    nearest port to heave down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore's interview with that
    whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the sperm
    whale will stand no nonsense.</p>

    <p>I will now refer you to Langsdorff's Voyages for a little circumstance in point, peculiarly interesting to the
    writer hereof. Langsdorff, you must know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern's famous
    Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century. Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth
    chapter:</p>

    <p>"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day we were out in the open sea, on our way to
    Ochotsh. The weather was very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur
    clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest
    sprang up. An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of
    the water, but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail, was
    almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him. We were thus placed in the most
    imminent danger, as this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the
    water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck,
    concluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity
    and solemnity. Captain D'Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any
    damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured."</p>

    <p>Now, the Captain D'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question, is a New Englander, who, after a long
    life of unusual adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston. I have the
    honour of being a nephew of his. I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff. He
    substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian
    coast, and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.</p>
