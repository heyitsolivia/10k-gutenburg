    <p>[A BURST OF REVELRY FROM THE FORECASTLE.]</p>

    <p>Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human mothers in them! Whelped somewhere by
    the sharkish sea. The white whale is their demigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is forward! mark the
    unfaltering silence aft! Methinks it pictures life. Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled,
    bantering bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods within his sternward cabin, builded over the
    dead water of the wake, and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. The long howl thrills me through! Peace! ye
    revellers, and set the watch! Oh, life! 'tis in an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to
    knowledge,&mdash;as wild, untutored things are forced to feed&mdash;Oh, life! 'tis now that I do feel the latent
    horror in thee! but 'tis not me! that horror's out of me! and with the soft feeling of the human in me, yet will I
    try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences!</p>

    <p>(STUBB SOLUS, AND MENDING A BRACE.)</p>

    <p>Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!&mdash;I've been thinking over it ever since, and that ha, ha's the final
    consequence. Why so? Because a laugh's the wisest, easiest answer to all that's queer; and come what will, one
    comfort's always left&mdash;that unfailing comfort is, it's all predestinated. I heard not all his talk with
    Starbuck; but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure the old Mogul has
    fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the gift, might readily have prophesied it&mdash;for when I clapped
    my eye upon his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, WISE Stubb&mdash;that's my title&mdash;well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb?
    Here's a carcase. I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will, I'll go to it laughing. Such a waggish
    leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra, skirra! What's my juicy little pear at home
    doing now? Crying its eyes out?&mdash;Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as a frigate's
    pennant, and so am I&mdash;fa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh&mdash;</p>

    <p>We'll drink to-night with hearts as light, To love, as gay and fleeting As bubbles that swim, on the beaker's
    brim, And break on the lips while meeting.</p>

    <p>A brave stave that&mdash;who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir&mdash;(ASIDE) he's my superior, he has his too,
    if I'm not mistaken.&mdash;Aye, aye, sir, just through with this job&mdash;coming.</p>

    <h3>HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.</h3>
    <p>(FORESAIL RISES AND DISCOVERS THE WATCH STANDING, LOUNGING, LEANING, AND LYING IN VARIOUS ATTITUDES, ALL SINGING
    IN CHORUS.)</p>

    <pre xml:space="preserve">Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies! Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain! Our
    captain's commanded.&mdash;</pre>
    <p>1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR. Oh, boys, don't be sentimental; it's bad for the digestion! Take a tonic, follow me!
    (SINGS, AND ALL FOLLOW)</p>

    <pre xml:space="preserve">Our captain stood upon the deck, A spy-glass in his hand, A viewing of those gallant
    whales That blew at every strand. Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys, And by your braces stand, And we'll have one
    of those fine whales, Hand, boys, over hand! So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail! While the bold
    harpooner is striking the whale!</pre>
    <p>MATE'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Eight bells there, forward!</p>

    <p>2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR. Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d'ye hear, bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip!
    thou blackling! and let me call the watch. I've the sort of mouth for that&mdash;the hogshead mouth. So, so,
    (THRUSTS HIS HEAD DOWN THE SCUTTLE,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight bells there below! Tumble up!</p>

    <p>DUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark this in our old Mogul's wine; it's quite
    as deadening to some as filliping to others. We sing; they sleep&mdash;aye, lie down there, like ground-tier butts.
    At 'em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail 'em through it. Tell 'em to avast dreaming of their lasses.
    Tell 'em it's the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment. That's the way&mdash;THAT'S it; thy
    throat ain't spoiled with eating Amsterdam butter.</p>

    <p>FRENCH SAILOR. Hist, boys! let's have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There
    comes the other watch. Stand by all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!</p>

    <p>PIP. (SULKY AND SLEEPY) Don't know where it is.</p>

    <p>FRENCH SAILOR. Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I say; merry's the word; hurrah! Damn me,
    won't you dance? Form, now, Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs! legs!</p>

    <p>ICELAND SAILOR. I don't like your floor, maty; it's too springy to my taste. I'm used to ice-floors. I'm sorry to
    throw cold water on the subject; but excuse me.</p>

    <p>MALTESE SAILOR. Me too; where's your girls? Who but a fool would take his left hand by his right, and say to
    himself, how d'ye do? Partners! I must have partners!</p>

    <p>SICILIAN SAILOR. Aye; girls and a green!&mdash;then I'll hop with ye; yea, turn grasshopper!</p>

    <p>LONG-ISLAND SAILOR. Well, well, ye sulkies, there's plenty more of us. Hoe corn when you may, say I. All legs go
    to harvest soon. Ah! here comes the music; now for it!</p>

    <p>AZORE SAILOR. (ASCENDING, AND PITCHING THE TAMBOURINE UP THE SCUTTLE.) Here you are, Pip; and there's the
    windlass-bitts; up you mount! Now, boys! (THE HALF OF THEM DANCE TO THE TAMBOURINE; SOME GO BELOW; SOME SLEEP OR LIE
    AMONG THE COILS OF RIGGING. OATHS A-PLENTY.)</p>

    <p>AZORE SAILOR. (DANCING) Go it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig it, stig it, quig it, bell-boy! Make
    fire-flies; break the jinglers!</p>

    <p>PIP. Jinglers, you say?&mdash;there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.</p>

    <p>CHINA SAILOR. Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of thyself.</p>

    <p>FRENCH SAILOR. Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it! Split jibs! tear yourselves!</p>

    <p>TASHTEGO. (QUIETLY SMOKING) That's a white man; he calls that fun: humph! I save my sweat.</p>

    <p>OLD MANX SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are dancing over. I'll dance over
    your grave, I will&mdash;that's the bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners. O
    Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews! Well, well; belike the whole world's a ball, as
    you scholars have it; and so 'tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads, you're young; I was once.</p>
