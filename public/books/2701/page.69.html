    <p>At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the
    whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and
    cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such
    circumstances. But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining
    himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea
    harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked
    nobler than the rider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with
    impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro's lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and
    Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes. The whales might have made one of their
    regular soundings, not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case, Stubb, as his wont in such
    cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,
    where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end; but
    hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooneer, whose eyes
    had been setting to windward like two fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat,
    crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, "Down, down all, and give way!&mdash;there they are!"</p>

    <p>To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been visible at that moment; nothing but a
    troubled bit of greenish white water, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and suffusingly blowing
    off to leeward, like the confused scud from white rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as
    it were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling, and
    partially beneath a thin layer of water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other
    indications, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.</p>

    <p>All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air. But it bade fair to outstrip
    them; it flew on and on, as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills.</p>

    <p>"Pull, pull, my good boys," said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men;
    while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two visible needles in
    two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only
    the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with
    command, now soft with entreaty.</p>

    <p>How different the loud little King-Post. "Sing out and say something, my hearties. Roar and pull, my
    thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I'll sign over to you my
    Martha's Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys. Lay me on&mdash;lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but
    I shall go stark, staring mad! See! see that white water!" And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his head, and
    stamped up and down on it; then picking it up, flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and
    plunging in the boat's stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.</p>

    <p>"Look at that chap now," philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained
    between his teeth, at a short distance, followed after&mdash;"He's got fits, that Flask has. Fits? yes, give him
    fits&mdash;that's the very word&mdash;pitch fits into 'em. Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you
    know;&mdash;merry's the word. Pull, babes&mdash;pull, sucklings&mdash;pull, all. But what the devil are you hurrying
    about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones,
    and bite your knives in two&mdash;that's all. Take it easy&mdash;why don't ye take it easy, I say, and burst all
    your livers and lungs!"</p>

    <p>But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of his&mdash;these were words best omitted
    here; for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas
    may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after
    his prey.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of Flask to "that whale," as he called the
    fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat's bow with its tail&mdash;these
    allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a
    fearful look over the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a
    skewer through their necks; usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but arms, in
    these critical moments.</p>

    <p>It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they
    made, as they rolled along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the brief suspended
    agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost seemed
    threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and
    goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other side;&mdash;all these,
    with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of
    the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming
    brood;&mdash;all this was thrilling.</p>

    <p>Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle; not the dead
    man's ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world;&mdash;neither of these can feel stranger and
    stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle
    of the hunted sperm whale.</p>

    <p>The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible, owing to the increasing
    darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung upon the sea. The jets of vapour no longer blended, but tilted everywhere to
    right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to
    three whales running dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the
    boat going with such madness through the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape
    being torn from the row-locks.</p>
