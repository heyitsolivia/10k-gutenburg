    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of The Whale.</h2>
    <p>What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid.</p>

    <p>Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which could not but occasionally awaken in any
    man's soul some alarm, there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at times by
    its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost
    despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me.
    But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these
    chapters might be naught.</p>

    <p>Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as if imparting some special virtue of its
    own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal
    preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the title "Lord of the White Elephants"
    above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same
    snow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white charger;
    and the great Austrian Empire, Caesarian, heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial
    hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over
    every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for among
    the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue
    is made the emblem of many touching, noble things&mdash;the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among
    the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour; though in many
    climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of
    kings and queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has
    been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame
    being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a
    snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the
    holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to
    the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for white,
    all Christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the
    cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the
    Passion of our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the
    four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there
    white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honourable, and sublime,
    there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than
    that redness which affrights in blood.</p>

    <p>This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when divorced from more kindly associations,
    and coupled with any object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white
    bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the
    transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more
    loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic
    coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark.*</p>

    <p>*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this
    matter, that it is not the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that
    brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the
    irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and
    hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a
    contrast. But even assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that
    intensified terror.</p>

    <p>As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature, when beheld in his ordinary
    moods, strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the
    French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for the dead begins with "Requiem eternam" (eternal
    rest), whence REQUIEM denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music. Now, in allusion to the white,
    silent stillness of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him REQUIN.</p>

    <p>Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread, in which that
    white phantom sails in all imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God's great, unflattering
    laureate, Nature.*</p>

    <p>*I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic
    seas. From my forenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I
    saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched
    forth its vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though
    bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king's ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange
    eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white
    thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable warping
    memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the
    things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he
    replied. Goney! never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to
    men ashore! never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some seaman's name for albatross. So that by no
    possibility could Coleridge's wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine, when
    I saw that bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in
    saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.</p>
