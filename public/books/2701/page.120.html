    <p>As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech
    that had fastened to him; as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the crazed
    creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving
    to steer through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and
    crushed.</p>

    <p>But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off from this monster directly across our route
    in advance; now edging away from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time, Starbuck
    stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for
    there was no time to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether
    dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business. "Out of the way, Commodore!" cried one,
    to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threatened to swamp us. "Hard
    down with your tail, there!" cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself
    with his own fan-like extremity.</p>

    <p>All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs.
    Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other's grain at
    right angles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the
    line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg
    is used. For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whales are not
    every day encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you
    must wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these the
    drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first and second were successfully
    darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing
    drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of
    tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it
    out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides
    the sea came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and so stopped the leaks
    for the time.</p>

    <p>It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not that as we advanced into the herd, our
    whale's way greatly diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from the circumference of
    commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing
    whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we glided between two whales into
    the innermost heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here the
    storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea
    presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in
    his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion.
    And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive pods
    of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so
    closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have
    gone round on their backs. Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding the
    embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must watch for a breach in the
    living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of
    the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed
    host.</p>

    <p>Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces
    between the various pods in any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the whole
    multitude, must have contained at least two or three square miles. At any rate&mdash;though indeed such a test at
    such a time might be deceptive&mdash;spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost
    from the rim of the horizon. I mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely
    locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning
    the precise cause of its stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and
    inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales&mdash;now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the
    margin of the lake&mdash;evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it
    was impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and
    touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg patted their
    foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained
    from darting it.</p>

    <p>But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed
    over the side. For, suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales, and
    those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a
    considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away
    from the breast, as if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still
    spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;&mdash;even so did the young of these whales seem looking up
    towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their sides, the
    mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a
    day old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He was a little frisky;
    though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the
    maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a
    Tartar's bow. The delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the plaited crumpled
    appearance of a baby's ears newly arrived from foreign parts.</p>
