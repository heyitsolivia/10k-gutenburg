    <p>Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items contingent. Every one knows that by the
    peculiar cunning of their gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the
    element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the
    surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human being's, the whale
    can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical
    visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the
    Sperm Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no
    connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the top of his head.</p>

    <p>If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws
    from the air a certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood
    its vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.
    Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his
    nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then live without breathing.
    Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his
    full hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a
    particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is
    supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the
    surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea,
    he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus
    supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is
    indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I
    consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase
    it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period
    of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times,
    that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over
    again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always
    dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told, will he
    finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates are
    different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out,
    unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity
    for the whale's rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast
    leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as
    the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!</p>

    <p>In man, breathing is incessantly going on&mdash;one breath only serving for two or three pulsations; so that
    whatever other business he has to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the Sperm
    Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.</p>

    <p>It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if it could truthfully be added that his
    spouts are mixed with water, then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems
    obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and
    being so clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But owing to the mystery
    of the spout&mdash;whether it be water or whether it be vapour&mdash;no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at
    on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories. But what does he want of
    them? No roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal, and as that long canal&mdash;like
    the grand Erie Canal&mdash;is furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of air
    or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying, that when he so
    strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say? Seldom have I known any
    profound being that had anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
    living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!</p>

    <p>Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air, and for several
    feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this curious
    canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether
    this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the
    exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the
    spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that
    this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would
    seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath the surface,
    and there he cannot spout even if he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch,
    you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary
    periods of respiration.</p>

    <p>But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You have seen him spout; then declare what
    the spout is; can you not tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain
    things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost
    stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.</p>
