    <p>Stubb's exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in
    general, and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this specimen of his
    sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his
    chief peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and
    fury, and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such queer
    invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time
    looked so easy and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly gaped&mdash;open-mouthed
    at times&mdash;that the mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon
    the crew. Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so curiously
    ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.</p>

    <p>In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across Stubb's bow; and when for a minute or
    so the two boats were pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye please!"</p>

    <p>"Halloa!" returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging
    his crew; his face set like a flint from Stubb's.</p>

    <p>"What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!</p>

    <p>"Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong, boys!)" in a whisper to his crew, then
    speaking out loud again: "A sad business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind, Mr. Stubb,
    all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There's hogsheads of
    sperm ahead, Mr. Stubb, and that's what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm's the play! This at least is
    duty; duty and profit hand in hand."</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye, I thought as much," soliloquized Stubb, when the boats diverged, "as soon as I clapt eye on 'em, I
    thought so. Aye, and that's what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long suspected. They were
    hidden down there. The White Whale's at the bottom of it. Well, well, so be it! Can't be helped! All right! Give
    way, men! It ain't the White Whale to-day! Give way!"</p>

    <p>Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the
    deck, this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship's company; but
    Archy's fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had
    in some small measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge of their wonder; and so what with
    all this and Stubb's confident way of accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from
    superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark
    Ahab's precise agency in the matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had
    seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the
    unaccountable Elijah.</p>

    <p>Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of
    the other boats; a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger yellow creatures of his
    seemed all steel and whalebone; like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which
    periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for
    Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked
    chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the
    watery horizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer's, thrown half backward into
    the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a
    thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion
    and then remained fixed, while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat motionless on
    the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily
    down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab
    had observed it.</p>

    <p>"Every man look out along his oars!" cried Starbuck. "Thou, Queequeg, stand up!"</p>

    <p>Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage stood erect there, and with intensely
    eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme stern of the
    boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly
    balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the
    sea.</p>

    <p>Not very far distant Flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still; its commander recklessly standing upon the
    top of the loggerhead, a stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the level of the
    stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a
    man's hand, and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk
    to all but her trucks. But little King-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post was full of a
    large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.</p>

    <p>"I can't see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to that."</p>

    <p>Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting
    himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal.</p>

    <p>"Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?"</p>

    <p>"That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you fifty feet taller."</p>

    <p>Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a
    little, presented his flat palm to Flask's foot, and then putting Flask's hand on his hearse-plumed head and bidding
    him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders.
    And here was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and
    steady himself by.</p>
