    <p>"The ungracious and ungrateful dog!" cried Starbuck; "he mocks and dares me with the very poor-box I filled for
    him not five minutes ago!"&mdash;then in his old intense whisper&mdash;"Give way, greyhounds! Dog to it!"</p>

    <p>"I tell ye what it is, men"&mdash;cried Stubb to his crew&mdash;"it's against my religion to get mad; but I'd
    like to eat that villainous Yarman&mdash;Pull&mdash;won't ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye love
    brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why don't some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who's that
    been dropping an anchor overboard&mdash;we don't budge an inch&mdash;we're becalmed. Halloo, here's grass growing in
    the boat's bottom&mdash;and by the Lord, the mast there's budding. This won't do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The
    short and long of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?"</p>

    <p>"Oh! see the suds he makes!" cried Flask, dancing up and down&mdash;"What a hump&mdash;Oh, DO pile on the
    beef&mdash;lays like a log! Oh! my lads, DO spring&mdash;slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my
    lads&mdash;baked clams and muffins&mdash;oh, DO, DO, spring,&mdash;he's a hundred barreller&mdash;don't lose him
    now&mdash;don't oh, DON'T!&mdash;see that Yarman&mdash;Oh, won't ye pull for your duff, my lads&mdash;such a sog!
    such a sogger! Don't ye love sperm? There goes three thousand dollars, men!&mdash;a bank!&mdash;a whole bank! The
    bank of England!&mdash;Oh, DO, DO, DO!&mdash;What's that Yarman about now?"</p>

    <p>At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the advancing boats, and also his oil-can;
    perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals' way, and at the same time economically accelerating his own by
    the momentary impetus of the backward toss.</p>

    <p>"The unmannerly Dutch dogger!" cried Stubb. "Pull now, men, like fifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of
    red-haired devils. What d'ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for the
    honour of old Gayhead? What d'ye say?"</p>

    <p>"I say, pull like god-dam,"&mdash;cried the Indian.</p>

    <p>Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod's three boats now began ranging almost
    abreast; and, so disposed, momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the headsman when
    drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an
    exhilarating cry of, "There she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman! Sail over
    him!"</p>

    <p>But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all their gallantry, he would have proved the
    victor in this race, had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship
    oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick's boat was
    nigh to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;&mdash;that was a good time for Starbuck,
    Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took a mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German's quarter.
    An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the whale's immediate wake, while stretching from them, on
    both sides, was the foaming swell that he made.</p>

    <p>It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was now going head out, and sending his spout
    before him in a continual tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to this
    hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank
    in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I seen a bird with clipped wing making
    affrighted broken circles in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a voice, and
    with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and
    enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made the sight of
    him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to
    appal the stoutest man who so pitied.</p>

    <p>Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod's boats the advantage, and rather than be thus
    foiled of his game, Derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the last
    chance would for ever escape.</p>

    <p>But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three tigers&mdash;Queequeg, Tashtego,
    Daggoo&mdash;instinctively sprang to their feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their barbs;
    and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three Nantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapours
    of foam and white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale's headlong rush, bumped the German's aside
    with such force, that both Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying
    keels.</p>

    <p>"Don't be afraid, my butter-boxes," cried Stubb, casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by; "ye'll be
    picked up presently&mdash;all right&mdash;I saw some sharks astern&mdash;St. Bernard's dogs, you know&mdash;relieve
    distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel a sunbeam! Hurrah!&mdash;Here we go like
    three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a
    plain&mdash;makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him that way; and there's danger of being pitched
    out too, when you strike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he's going to Davy Jones&mdash;all a
    rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this whale carries the everlasting mail!"</p>

    <p>But the monster's run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the
    three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them; while so fearful were the
    harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they caught
    repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at last&mdash;owing to the perpendicular strain from the
    lead-lined chocks of the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue&mdash;the gunwales of the
    bows were almost even with the water, while the three sterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to
    sound, for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the position was a
    little ticklish. But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this "holding on," as it is
    called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments the
    Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of the thing, it
    is to be doubted whether this course is always the best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the
    stricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because, owing to the enormous surface of him&mdash;in a
    full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet&mdash;the pressure of the water is immense. We all know
    what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how vast,
    then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal
    the weight of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with
    all their guns, and stores, and men on board.</p>
