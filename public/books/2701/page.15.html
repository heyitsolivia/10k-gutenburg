    <p>While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting storm without seemed to add new power
    to the preacher, who, when describing Jonah's sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep chest heaved as
    with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off
    his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that
    was strange to them.</p>

    <p>There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves of the Book once more; and, at last,
    standing motionless, with closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.</p>

    <p>But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet
    manliest humility, he spake these words:</p>

    <p>"Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon me. I have read ye by what murky light
    may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a
    greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where
    you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads ME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah
    teaches to ME, as a pilot of the living God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things, and
    bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility
    he should raise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa. But God
    is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to
    living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along 'into the midst of the seas,' where the eddying depths
    sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and 'the weeds were wrapped about his head,' and all the watery world of woe
    bowled over him. Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet&mdash;'out of the belly of hell'&mdash;when the whale
    grounded upon the ocean's utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then
    God spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up towards
    the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth; and 'vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;' when
    the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten&mdash;his ears, like two sea-shells, still
    multitudinously murmuring of the ocean&mdash;Jonah did the Almighty's bidding. And what was that, shipmates? To
    preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!</p>

    <p>"This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it. Woe to him
    whom this world charms from Gospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them
    into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than
    goodness! Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonour! Woe to him who would not be true, even though to be
    false were salvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is himself a
    castaway!"</p>

    <p>He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his face to them again, showed a deep joy in his
    eyes, as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm,&mdash;"But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of every woe,
    there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the
    main-truck higher than the kelson is low? Delight is to him&mdash;a far, far upward, and inward delight&mdash;who
    against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him
    whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him. Delight
    is to him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from
    under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,&mdash;top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or
    lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of
    the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and
    deliciousness will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath&mdash;O Father!&mdash;chiefly
    known to me by Thy rod&mdash;mortal or immortal, here I die. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this
    world's, or mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he should live out the
    lifetime of his God?"</p>

    <p>He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with his hands, and so remained kneeling, till
    all the people had departed, and he was left alone in the place.</p>

    <p>Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there quite alone; he having left the Chapel
    before the benediction some time. He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and
    in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a
    jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.</p>

    <p>But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to the table, took up a large book there,
    and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page&mdash;as I
    fancied&mdash;stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle
    of astonishment. He would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number one each time, as though
    he could not count more than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his
    astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.</p>

    <p>With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and hideously marred about the face&mdash;at least
    to my taste&mdash;his countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot hide the
    soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large,
    deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils. And besides all
    this, there was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim. He
    looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being
    shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would,
    this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem
    ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington's head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same
    long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two long
    promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.</p>
