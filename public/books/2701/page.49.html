    <p>Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with
    those enviable little tents or pulpits, called CROW'S-NESTS, in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler are
    protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled "A
    Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost
    Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;" in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a
    charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented CROW'S-NEST of the Glacier, which was the name of
    Captain Sleet's good craft. He called it the SLEET'S CROW'S-NEST, in honour of himself; he being the original
    inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children
    after our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after
    ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large tierce or
    pipe; it is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head
    in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom.
    On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for
    umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe,
    telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow's-nest of
    his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and
    shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you
    cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon them is
    a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the
    little detailed conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats
    us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow's-nest, with a small compass he kept there for the
    purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the "local attraction" of all binnacle magnets; an
    error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship's planks, and in the Glacier's case, perhaps, to
    there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very discreet
    and scientific here, yet, for all his learned "binnacle deviations," "azimuth compass observations," and
    "approximate errors," he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic
    meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely
    tucked in on one side of his crow's nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire
    and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly
    ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers
    and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest within three or four perches of the
    pole.</p>

    <p>But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet
    that disadvantage is greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we
    South fishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a
    chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there; then ascending a little way further, and
    throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at last mount to
    my ultimate destination.</p>

    <p>Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but sorry guard. With the problem of the
    universe revolving in me, how could I&mdash;being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering
    altitude&mdash;how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships' standing orders, "Keep your
    weather eye open, and sing out every time."</p>

    <p>And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant
    fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who offers to ship with
    the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can
    be killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world, and never make you one pint
    of sperm the richer. Nor are these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery furnishes an asylum
    for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking
    sentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the mast-head of some luckless
    disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase ejaculates:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain."</p>

    <p>Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young philosophers to task, upbraiding them
    with not feeling sufficient "interest" in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all
    honourable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain;
    those young Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are short-sighted; what use, then, to
    strain the visual nerve? They have left their opera-glasses at home.</p>

    <p>"Why, thou monkey," said a harpooneer to one of these lads, "we've been cruising now hard upon three years, and
    thou hast not raised a whale yet. Whales are scarce as hen's teeth whenever thou art up here." Perhaps they were; or
    perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of
    vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last
    he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul,
    pervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every
    dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts
    that only people the soul by continually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence
    it came; becomes diffused through time and space; like Crammer's sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part
    of every shore the round globe over.</p>
