    <p>"Come down, come down!" yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles, so that
    if the head should drop, he would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line, rammed down the
    bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.</p>

    <p>"In heaven's name, man," cried Stubb, "are you ramming home a cartridge there?&mdash;Avast! How will that help
    him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on top of his head? Avast, will ye!"</p>

    <p>"Stand clear of the tackle!" cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket.</p>

    <p>Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass dropped into the sea, like Niagara's
    Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering copper;
    and all caught their breath, as half swinging&mdash;now over the sailors' heads, and now over the
    water&mdash;Daggoo, through a thick mist of spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,
    buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea! But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared
    away, when a naked figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen hovering over the
    bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made
    to the side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and no sign of either the sinker or the
    diver could be seen. Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the ship.</p>

    <p>"Ha! ha!" cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch overhead; and looking further off from
    the side, we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust forth from the
    grass over a grave.</p>

    <p>"Both! both!&mdash;it is both!"&mdash;cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and soon after, Queequeg was seen
    boldly striking out with one hand, and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the waiting
    boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very
    brisk.</p>

    <p>Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the slowly descending head, Queequeg with his
    keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his sword, had
    thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first
    thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might occasion
    great trouble;&mdash;he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the
    Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old way&mdash;head foremost. As for the great head
    itself, that was doing as well as could be expected.</p>

    <p>And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of
    Tashtego, was successfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently hopeless
    impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same course with
    fencing and boxing, riding and rowing.</p>

    <p>I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header's will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen, though
    they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one's falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which not
    seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the Indian's, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb
    of the Sperm Whale's well.</p>

    <p>But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought the tissued, infiltrated head of the
    Sperm Whale, was the lightest and most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far
    greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell
    in, the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the
    well&mdash;a double welded, hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump
    of which sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present
    instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very
    slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as
    you may say. Yes, it was a running delivery, so it was.</p>

    <p>Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious perishing; smothered in the very whitest and
    daintiest of fragrant spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of
    the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled&mdash;the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who
    seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that leaning too far over, it sucked
    him in, so that he died embalmed. How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato's honey head, and sweetly
    perished there?</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 79. The Prairie.</h2>
    <p>To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this Leviathan; this is a thing which no
    Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater
    to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar, or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the
    Dome of the Pantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men, but
    also attentively studies the faces of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the modifications
    of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching
    the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer,
    in the application of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all things; I achieve what
    I can.</p>

    <p>Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He has no proper nose. And since the nose is
    the central and most conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their
    combined expression; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect
    the countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is
    deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without
    the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the nose from Phidias's marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!
    Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency
    which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is an added grandeur. A nose to the
    whale would have been impertinent. As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly-boat,
    your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent
    conceit, which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his
    throne.</p>
