    <p>"Queequeg!&mdash;Queequeg!"&mdash;all still. Something must have happened. Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the
    door; but it stubbornly resisted. Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I
    met&mdash;the chamber-maid. "La! la!" she cried, "I thought something must be the matter. I went to make the bed
    after breakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it's been just so silent ever since. But
    I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma'am!&mdash;Mistress!
    murder! Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!"&mdash;and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I following.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken
    away from the occupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy meantime.</p>

    <p>"Wood-house!" cried I, "which way to it? Run for God's sake, and fetch something to pry open the door&mdash;the
    axe!&mdash;the axe! he's had a stroke; depend upon it!"&mdash;and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs
    again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her
    countenance.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter with you, young man?"</p>

    <p>"Get the axe! For God's sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry it open!"</p>

    <p>"Look here," said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; "look here;
    are you talking about prying open any of my doors?"&mdash;and with that she seized my arm. "What's the matter with
    you? What's the matter with you, shipmate?"</p>

    <p>In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the whole case. Unconsciously clapping the
    vinegar-cruet to one side of her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed&mdash;"No! I haven't seen it
    since I put it there." Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning,
    told me that Queequeg's harpoon was missing. "He's killed himself," she cried. "It's unfort'nate Stiggs done over
    again there goes another counterpane&mdash;God pity his poor mother!&mdash;it will be the ruin of my house. Has the
    poor lad a sister? Where's that girl?&mdash;there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a
    sign, with&mdash;"no suicides permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;"&mdash;might as well kill both birds at
    once. Kill? The Lord be merciful to his ghost! What's that noise there? You, young man, avast there!"</p>

    <p>And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open the door.</p>

    <p>"I don't allow it; I won't have my premises spoiled. Go for the locksmith, there's one about a mile from here.
    But avast!" putting her hand in her side-pocket, "here's a key that'll fit, I guess; let's see." And with that, she
    turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg's supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.</p>

    <p>"Have to burst it open," said I, and was running down the entry a little, for a good start, when the landlady
    caught at me, again vowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily rush
    dashed myself full against the mark.</p>

    <p>With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming against the wall, sent the plaster to the
    ceiling; and there, good heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right in the middle of the
    room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head. He looked neither one way nor the other way, but
    sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.</p>

    <p>"Queequeg," said I, going up to him, "Queequeg, what's the matter with you?"</p>

    <p>"He hain't been a sittin' so all day, has he?" said the landlady.</p>

    <p>But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like pushing him over, so as to change his
    position, for it was almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained; especially, as in all
    probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.</p>

    <p>"Mrs. Hussey," said I, "he's ALIVE at all events; so leave us, if you please, and I will see to this strange
    affair myself."</p>

    <p>Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he
    sat; and all he could do&mdash;for all my polite arts and blandishments&mdash;he would not move a peg, nor say a
    single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in the slightest way.</p>

    <p>I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do they fast on their hams that way in his
    native island. It must be so; yes, it's part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he'll get up sooner
    or later, no doubt. It can't last for ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don't believe
    it's very punctual then.</p>

    <p>I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come
    from a plum-pudding voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig, confined to
    the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven
    o'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his
    Ramadan to a termination. But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to
    grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on
    his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his head.</p>

    <p>"For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have some supper. You'll starve; you'll kill
    yourself, Queequeg." But not a word did he reply.</p>

    <p>Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and no doubt, before a great while, he
    would follow me. But previous to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it promised
    to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could
    not get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of Queequeg&mdash;not four feet
    off&mdash;sitting there in that uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched.
    Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable
    Ramadan!</p>

    <p>But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of day; when, looking over the bedside, there
    squatted Queequeg, as if he had been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the
    window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed
    his forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.</p>
