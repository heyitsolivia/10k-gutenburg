    <p>At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me. His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed
    his filed and pointed teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast; ducked and
    dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a
    wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So full of this reeling scene were we, as we
    stood by the plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a
    lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were
    anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their
    intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young
    saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the
    brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily
    into the air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet,
    while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.</p>

    <p>"Capting! Capting!" yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer; "Capting, Capting, here's the devil."</p>

    <p>"Hallo, <em>you</em> sir," cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking up to Queequeg, "what in thunder do
    you mean by that? Don't you know you might have killed that chap?"</p>

    <p>"What him say?" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.</p>

    <p>"He say," said I, "that you came near kill-e that man there," pointing to the still shivering greenhorn.</p>

    <p>"Kill-e," cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain, "ah! him bevy
    small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!"</p>

    <p>"Look you," roared the Captain, "I'll kill-e YOU, you cannibal, if you try any more of your tricks aboard here;
    so mind your eye."</p>

    <p>But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye. The prodigious strain
    upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side,
    completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was
    swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. It flew
    from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of
    snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed towards
    the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of this
    consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a
    rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it
    swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run
    into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from
    the side with a long living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his
    long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked
    at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself
    perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see just how
    matters were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and
    with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands
    voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle;
    yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.</p>

    <p>Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and
    Magnanimous Societies. He only asked for water&mdash;fresh water&mdash;something to wipe the brine off; that done,
    he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him,
    seemed to be saying to himself&mdash;"It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We cannibals must help
    these Christians."</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.</h2>
    <p>Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a fine run, we safely arrived in
    Nantucket.</p>

    <p>Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of the world it occupies; how it stands
    there, away off shore, more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it&mdash;a mere hillock, and elbow of
    sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute
    for blotting paper. Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they don't grow
    naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil
    cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome; that people there
    plant toadstools before their houses, to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an oasis,
    three blades in a day's walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that
    they are so shut up, belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean, that to
    their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these
    extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.</p>

    <p>Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend.
    In olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his talons.
    With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the
    same direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they
    found an empty ivory casket,&mdash;the poor little Indian's skeleton.</p>

    <p>What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take to the sea for a livelihood! They first
    caught crabs and quohogs in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more experienced, they
    pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery
    world; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at Behring's Straits; and in all seasons and
    all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most monstrous and
    most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that
    his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults!</p>
