    <p>Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a
    spring-carriage ashore. But the awful lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the middle
    of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open
    sea&mdash;mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.</p>

    <p>But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he did not mean to, at least. Because there
    were two boats in his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly, and
    pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not
    always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost
    invariably in the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military
    navies and armies.</p>

    <p>But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly spying whales close to them on one side,
    turned, and gave chase; and Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that
    Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;
    but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The sea had
    jeeringly kept his finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though. Rather
    carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before
    his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless,
    ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of
    waters heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it; and therefore his
    shipmates called him mad. So man's insanity is heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at
    last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,
    indifferent as his God.</p>

    <p>For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that fishery; and in the sequel of the
    narrative, it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of the Hand.</h2>
    <p>That whale of Stubb's, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the Pequod's side, where all those cutting and
    hoisting operations previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of the Heidelburgh Tun, or
    Case.</p>

    <p>While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as
    filled with the sperm; and when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the
    try-works, of which anon.</p>

    <p>It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with several others, I sat down before a large
    Constantine's bath of it, I found it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about in the liquid
    part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old
    times this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener! such a softener! such a delicious
    molifier! After having my hands in it for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it were, to
    serpentine and spiralise.</p>

    <p>As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter exertion at the windlass; under a blue
    tranquil sky; the ship under indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among those soft,
    gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and
    discharged all their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that uncontaminated
    aroma,&mdash;literally and truly, like the smell of spring violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as
    in a musky meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible sperm, I washed my hands and my heart
    of it; I almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of
    anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort
    whatsoever.</p>

    <p>Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I
    squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my
    co-laborers' hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly,
    loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into
    their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,&mdash;Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any
    social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all
    squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of
    kindness.</p>

    <p>Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I
    have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable felicity;
    not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle,
    the fireside, the country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of
    the visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.</p>

    <p>Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things akin to it, in the business of preparing
    the sperm whale for the try-works.</p>

    <p>First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish, and also from the
    thicker portions of his flukes. It is tough with congealed tendons&mdash;a wad of muscle&mdash;but still contains
    some oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the
    mincer. They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble.</p>

    <p>Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale's flesh, here and there adhering to
    the blanket of blubber, and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is a most
    refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint,
    with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple. It is plums of
    rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I
    stole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis
    le Gros might have tasted, supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season, and that
    particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.</p>
