    <p>That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given to the enlightened world by the
    whaleman. After its first blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as
    pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty
    colony. Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were several times saved from
    starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted
    isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for
    the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations.
    If that double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will
    be due; for already she is on the threshold.</p>

    <p>But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations connected
    with it, then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet every time.</p>

    <p>The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you will say.</p>

    <p>THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR, AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER? Who wrote the first account of our Leviathan? Who
    but mighty Job! And who composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than Alfred the
    Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And
    who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!</p>

    <p>True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no good blood in their veins.</p>

    <p>NO GOOD BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS? They have something better than royal blood there. The grandmother of Benjamin
    Franklin was Mary Morrel; afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the
    ancestress to a long line of Folgers and harpooneers&mdash;all kith and kin to noble Benjamin&mdash;this day darting
    the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.</p>

    <p>Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable.</p>

    <p>WHALING NOT RESPECTABLE? Whaling is imperial! By old English statutory law, the whale is declared "a royal
    fish."*</p>

    <p>Oh, that's only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing way.</p>

    <p>THE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND IMPOSING WAY? In one of the mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon
    his entering the world's capital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian coast, were the most
    conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*</p>

    <p>*See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.</p>

    <p>Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real dignity in whaling.</p>

    <p>NO DIGNITY IN WHALING? The dignity of our calling the very heavens attest. Cetus is a constellation in the South!
    No more! Drive down your hat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I know a man that, in
    his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty whales. I account that man more honourable than that great captain
    of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.</p>

    <p>And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever
    deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of; if
    hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather have done than to have left undone; if, at my
    death, my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any precious MSS. in my desk, then here I prospectively
    ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.</p>

    <p>In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but substantiated facts. But after embattling
    his facts, an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell eloquently upon his
    cause&mdash;such an advocate, would he not be blameworthy?</p>

    <p>It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern ones, a certain curious process of
    seasoning them for their functions is gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may be a
    castor of state. How they use the salt, precisely&mdash;who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king's head is
    solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be, though, that they anoint it with a view of
    making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here, concerning the essential
    dignity of this regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his
    hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man
    has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can't amount to much in his totality.</p>

    <p>But the only thing to be considered here, is this&mdash;what kind of oil is used at coronations? Certainly it
    cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear's oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. What then
    can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?</p>

    <p>Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff!</p>
