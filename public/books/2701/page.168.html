    <p>"The birds!&mdash;the birds!" cried Tashtego.</p>

    <p>In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when
    within a few yards began fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous, expectant cries.
    Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down
    into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity
    uprising, and magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of
    white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick's open mouth and scrolled jaw;
    his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea. The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat
    like an open-doored marble tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside
    from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows,
    and seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.</p>

    <p>Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its bow, by anticipation, was made to face
    the whale's head while yet under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that malicious
    intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head
    lengthwise beneath the boat.</p>

    <p>Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on
    his back, in the manner of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that the
    long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The
    bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab's head, and reached higher than that. In
    this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With unastonished eyes
    Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to gain the
    uttermost stern.</p>

    <p>And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in
    this devilish way; and from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from the bows, for
    the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick
    crisis impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe,
    which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized the long bone
    with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped
    from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further
    aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two floating
    wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and
    striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across.</p>

    <p>At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first to perceive the whale's intent, by the
    crafty upraising of his head, a movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had made one
    final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over
    sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the
    push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.</p>

    <p>Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little distance, vertically thrusting his oblong
    white head up and down in the billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body; so that when
    his vast wrinkled forehead rose&mdash;some twenty or more feet out of the water&mdash;the now rising swells, with
    all their confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into
    the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone,
    triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.</p>

    <p>*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to
    that preliminary up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously described. By
    this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.</p>

    <p>But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew; sideways
    churning the water in his vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault. The
    sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's
    elephants in the book of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale's insolent tail, and too
    much of a cripple to swim,&mdash;though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;
    helpless Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst. From the boat's
    fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not
    succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White
    Whale's aspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed horizontally swooping
    upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to
    strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor
    in that case could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on the outer edge of the
    direful zone, whose centre had now become the old man's head.</p>

    <p>Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship's mast heads; and squaring her yards, she
    had borne down upon the scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!&mdash;"Sail on the"&mdash;but
    that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it
    again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,&mdash;"Sail on the whale!&mdash;Drive him off!"</p>

    <p>The Pequod's prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle, she effectually parted the white whale from
    his victim. As he sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.</p>
