    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 67. Cutting In.</h2>
    <p>It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio professors of Sabbath breaking are all
    whalemen. The ivory Pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would have thought we
    were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.</p>

    <p>In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks
    generally painted green, and which no single man can possibly lift&mdash;this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to
    the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a ship's deck. The end of
    the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block
    of the tackles was swung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one hundred pounds, was
    attached. And now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades,
    began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins. This
    done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the main body of the crew striking
    up a wild chorus, now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship careens
    over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles,
    quivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the whale, while every gasping
    heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap is
    heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into
    sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as the blubber envelopes
    the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is
    sometimes stripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale
    rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the
    "scarf," simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled
    off, and indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end
    grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious
    blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one present must take good heed to dodge
    it when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.</p>

    <p>One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his
    chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole, the end
    of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare
    for what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a
    scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain; so
    that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is
    all ready for lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting
    a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main
    hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry
    nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And thus
    the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the
    heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing
    occasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.</h2>
    <p>I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of the whale. I have had controversies
    about it with experienced whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains unchanged;
    but it is only an opinion.</p>

    <p>The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you know what his blubber is. That blubber is
    something of the consistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and ranges from
    eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.</p>

    <p>Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature's skin as being of that sort of
    consistence and thickness, yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption; because you
    cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale's body but that same blubber; and the outermost
    enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin? True, from the unmarred dead
    body of the whale, you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling
    the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried,
    when it not only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits, which
    I use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon the printed page, I have
    sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about
    whales through their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am driving at here is this. That same infinitely
    thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as
    the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the
    proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child. But no more of
    this.</p>
