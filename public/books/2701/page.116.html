    <p>The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell
    whether any water falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his
    spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him. And if at such times you should think
    that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely condensed from
    its vapour; or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole
    fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale's head? For even when tranquilly swimming through the
    mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in the desert; even then, the whale always
    carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled
    up with rain.</p>

    <p>Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout. It
    will not do for him to be peering into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to this
    fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of
    the jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing so touching it.
    And I know one, who coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or
    otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed
    poisonous; they try to evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is
    fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is
    to let this deadly spout alone.</p>

    <p>Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My hypothesis is this: that the spout is
    nothing but mist. And besides other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the great
    inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an
    undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are. He is both
    ponderous and profound. And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as Plato,
    Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of
    thinking deep thoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before
    me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The
    invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic,
    of an August noon; this seems an additional argument for the above supposition.</p>

    <p>And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm
    tropical sea; his vast, mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his incommunicable contemplations,
    and that vapour&mdash;as you will sometimes see it&mdash;glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its
    seal upon his thoughts. For, d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapour. And so,
    through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog
    with a heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along with
    them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes
    neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 86. The Tail.</h2>
    <p>Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope, and the lovely plumage of the bird that
    never alights; less celestial, I celebrate a tail.</p>

    <p>Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the
    girth of a man, it comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The compact round
    body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in
    thickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like
    wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in
    the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably
    exceed twenty feet across.</p>

    <p>The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut into it, and you find that three distinct
    strata compose it:&mdash;upper, middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and
    horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running crosswise between the outside layers. This triune
    structure, as much as anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman walls, the middle layer
    will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful
    relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry.</p>

    <p>But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit
    over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins and running down
    into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the
    confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point. Could annihilation occur to matter,
    this were the thing to do it.</p>

    <p>Nor does this&mdash;its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions; where
    infantileness of ease undulates through a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most
    appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything
    imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting
    from the marble in the carved Hercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from
    the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal
    arch. When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there. And whatever they may
    reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has
    been most successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any
    power, but the mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form the
    peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.</p>
