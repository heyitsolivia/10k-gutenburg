    <p>The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a milk-white ground colour, dotted with round
    and oblong spots of black. His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is seldom
    hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.</p>

    <p>BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER IV. (KILLER).&mdash;Of this whale little is precisely known to the Nantucketer, and
    nothing at all to the professed naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say that he was
    about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage&mdash;a sort of Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio
    whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death. The Killer is never
    hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has. Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the
    ground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.</p>

    <p>BOOK II. (OCTAVO), CHAPTER V. (THRASHER).&mdash;This gentleman is famous for his tail, which he uses for a ferule
    in thrashing his foes. He mounts the Folio whale's back, and as he swims, he works his passage by flogging him; as
    some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the
    Killer. Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.</p>

    <p>Thus ends BOOK II. (OCTAVO), and begins BOOK III. (DUODECIMO).</p>

    <p>DUODECIMOES.&mdash;These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise. II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The
    Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.</p>

    <p>To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may possibly seem strange, that fishes not
    commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES&mdash;a word, which, in the popular sense,
    always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the
    terms of my definition of what a whale is&mdash;i.e. a spouting fish, with a horizontal tail.</p>

    <p>BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER 1. (HUZZA PORPOISE).&mdash;This is the common porpoise found almost all over the
    globe. The name is of my own bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something must be done to
    distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep
    tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their appearance is generally hailed with delight
    by the mariner. Full of fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward. They are the lads
    that always live before the wind. They are accounted a lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at
    beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed,
    plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his
    jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones.
    Porpoise meat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout
    is so small that it is not very readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and you will
    then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.</p>

    <p>BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER II. (ALGERINE PORPOISE).&mdash;A pirate. Very savage. He is only found, I think,
    in the Pacific. He is somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make. Provoke him, and
    he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many times, but never yet saw him captured.</p>

    <p>BOOK III. (DUODECIMO), CHAPTER III. (MEALY-MOUTHED PORPOISE).&mdash;The largest kind of Porpoise; and only found
    in the Pacific, so far as it is known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been designated, is that of
    the fishers&mdash;Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that
    Folio. In shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly girth; indeed,
    he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has a
    lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down
    to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship's hull, called the "bright
    waist," that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below. The white
    comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a
    felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of the common porpoise.</p>

    <p>Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales.
    Above, you have all the Leviathans of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous whales,
    which, as an American whaleman, I know by reputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their
    fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may complete what I
    have here but begun. If any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be
    incorporated into this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:&mdash;The Bottle-Nose Whale;
    the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the
    Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic, Dutch,
    and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of
    uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of
    Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.</p>

    <p>Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here, and at once, perfected. You cannot but
    plainly see that I have kept my word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished, even as the
    great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small
    erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity.
    God keep me from ever completing anything. This whole book is but a draught&mdash;nay, but the draught of a draught.
    Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!</p>

    <p>Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic
    peculiarity on ship-board, arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of course
    in any other marine than the whale-fleet.</p>
