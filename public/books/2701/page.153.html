    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 117. The Whale Watch.</h2>
    <p>The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one
    ahead; one astern. These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one could not be reached
    till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab's.</p>

    <p>The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale's spout-hole; and the lantern hanging from its top, cast a
    troubled flickering glare upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which gently chafed the
    whale's broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.</p>

    <p>Ahab and all his boat's crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks,
    that spectrally played round the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A sound like the moaning
    in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.</p>

    <p>Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and hooped round by the gloom of the night they
    seemed the last men in a flooded world. "I have dreamed it again," said he.</p>

    <p>"Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine?"</p>

    <p>"And who are hearsed that die on the sea?"</p>

    <p>"But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the
    sea; the first not made by mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America."</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:&mdash;a hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for
    the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a sight we shall not soon see."</p>

    <p>"Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man."</p>

    <p>"And what was that saying about thyself?"</p>

    <p>"Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot."</p>

    <p>"And when thou art so gone before&mdash;if that ever befall&mdash;then ere I can follow, thou must still appear
    to me, to pilot me still?&mdash;Was it not so? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two
    pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it."</p>

    <p>"Take another pledge, old man," said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up like fire-flies in the gloom&mdash;"Hemp
    only can kill thee."</p>

    <p>"The gallows, ye mean.&mdash;I am immortal then, on land and on sea," cried Ahab, with a laugh of
    derision;&mdash;"Immortal on land and on sea!"</p>

    <p>Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the slumbering crew arose from the boat's bottom,
    and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.</h2>
    <p>The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab, coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft,
    the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces, and
    would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the
    ship's prow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows
    of his high-hoisted boat, was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude.</p>

    <p>Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese
    sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy ocean's immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks lacquered; clouds there
    are none; the horizon floats; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God's
    throne. Well that Ahab's quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses, through which to take sight of that solar
    fire. So, swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrument placed to
    his eye, he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its
    precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship's
    deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab's, was eyeing the same sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded
    their orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired observation was
    taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise
    instant. Then falling into a moment's revery, he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself: "Thou
    sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly where I AM&mdash;but canst thou cast the least hint
    where I SHALL be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living? Where is Moby Dick?
    This instant thou must be eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him; aye,
    and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou
    sun!"</p>

    <p>Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its numerous cabalistical contrivances, he
    pondered again, and muttered: "Foolish toy! babies' plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores, and Captains; the
    world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point,
    where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that holds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou
    canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy impotence thou
    insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy; and cursed be all the things that cast man's eyes aloft to
    that heaven, whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light, O sun!
    Level by nature to this earth's horizon are the glances of man's eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as if
    God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou quadrant!" dashing it to the deck, "no longer will I
    guide my earthly way by thee; the level ship's compass, and the level deadreckoning, by log and by line; THESE shall
    conduct me, and show me my place on the sea. Aye," lighting from the boat to the deck, "thus I trample on thee, thou
    paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and destroy thee!"</p>
