    <p>"'My wrist is sprained with ye!' he cried, at last; 'but there is still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam,
    that wouldn't give up. Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.'</p>

    <p>"For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting
    round his head, said in a sort of hiss, 'What I say is this&mdash;and mind it well&mdash;if you flog me, I murder
    you!'</p>

    <p>"'Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me'&mdash;and the Captain drew off with the rope to strike.</p>

    <p>"'Best not,' hissed the Lakeman.</p>

    <p>"'But I must,'&mdash;and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.</p>

    <p>"Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain; who, to the amazement of all hands,
    started back, paced the deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, 'I won't do
    it&mdash;let him go&mdash;cut him down: d'ye hear?'</p>

    <p>"But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man, with a bandaged head, arrested
    them&mdash;Radney the chief mate. Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the
    tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole scene. Such was the state of his mouth,
    that he could hardly speak; but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not
    attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.</p>

    <p>"'You are a coward!' hissed the Lakeman.</p>

    <p>"'So I am, but take that.' The mate was in the very act of striking, when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm.
    He paused: and then pausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt's threat, whatever that might have been.
    The three men were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps
    clanged as before.</p>

    <p>"Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was heard in the forecastle; and the two
    trembling traitors running up, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew. Entreaties,
    cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put down in the ship's run for
    salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at
    Steelkilt's instigation, they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and,
    when the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all
    agreed to another thing&mdash;namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of
    her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just
    as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the
    mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital
    jaw of the whale.</p>

    <p>"But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept his
    own counsel (at least till all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung
    him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate's watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to
    run more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of
    the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt
    systematically built the plan of his revenge.</p>

    <p>"During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his
    arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship's side. In this attitude, it
    was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between
    this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two
    o'clock, in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure, he employed the
    interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below.</p>

    <p>"'What are you making there?' said a shipmate.</p>

    <p>"'What do you think? what does it look like?'</p>

    <p>"'Like a lanyard for your bag; but it's an odd one, seems to me.'</p>

    <p>"'Yes, rather oddish,' said the Lakeman, holding it at arm's length before him; 'but I think it will answer.
    Shipmate, I haven't enough twine,&mdash;have you any?'</p>

    <p>"But there was none in the forecastle.</p>

    <p>"'Then I must get some from old Rad;' and he rose to go aft.</p>

    <p>"'You don't mean to go a begging to HIM!' said a sailor.</p>

    <p>"'Why not? Do you think he won't do me a turn, when it's to help himself in the end, shipmate?' and going to the
    mate, he looked at him quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given him&mdash;neither
    twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of
    the Lakeman's monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his
    trick at the silent helm&mdash;nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman's
    hand&mdash;that fatal hour was then to come; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark
    and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.</p>

    <p>"But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he
    had, and without being the avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his
    hands into its own the damning thing he would have done.</p>

    <p>"It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day, when they were washing down the
    decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, 'There she rolls!
    there she rolls!' Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.</p>

    <p>"'Moby Dick!' cried Don Sebastian; 'St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do whales have christenings? Whom call you Moby
    Dick?'</p>

    <p>"'A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;&mdash;but that would be too long a
    story.'</p>

    <p>"'How? how?' cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.</p>

    <p>"'Nay, Dons, Dons&mdash;nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more into the air, Sirs.'</p>

    <p>"'The chicha! the chicha!' cried Don Pedro; 'our vigorous friend looks faint;&mdash;fill up his empty
    glass!'</p>
