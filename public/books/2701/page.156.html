    <p>"The boat! the boat!" cried Starbuck, "look at thy boat, old man!"</p>

    <p>Ahab's harpoon, the one forged at Perth's fire, remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it
    projected beyond his whale-boat's bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to
    drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon
    burned there like a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm&mdash;"God, God is against thee, old man;
    forbear! 'tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a
    fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this."</p>

    <p>Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces&mdash;though not a sail was left aloft.
    For the moment all the aghast mate's thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But dashing the
    rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them;
    swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope's end. Petrified by his aspect, and still
    more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old
    Ahab is bound. And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out the last fear!" And
    with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame.</p>

    <p>As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height
    and strength but render it so much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts; so at those
    last words of Ahab's many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay.</p>

    <h3>AHAB STANDING BY THE HELM. STARBUCK APPROACHING HIM.</h3>
    <p>"We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working loose and the lee lift is half-stranded.
    Shall I strike it, sir?"</p>

    <p>"Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I'd sway them up now."</p>

    <p>"Sir!&mdash;in God's name!&mdash;sir?"</p>

    <p>"Well."</p>

    <p>"The anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?"</p>

    <p>"Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises, but it has not got up to my table-lands
    yet. Quick, and see to it.&mdash;By masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some coasting
    smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds, and this
    brain-truck of mine now sails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but cowards send down their
    brain-trucks in tempest time. What a hooroosh aloft there! I would e'en take it for sublime, did I not know that the
    colic is a noisy malady. Oh, take medicine, take medicine!"</p>

    <p>STUBB AND FLASK MOUNTED ON THEM, AND PASSING ADDITIONAL LASHINGS OVER THE ANCHORS THERE HANGING.</p>

    <p>"No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but you will never pound into me what you were
    just now saying. And how long ago is it since you said the very contrary? Didn't you once say that whatever ship
    Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with
    powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn't you say so?"</p>

    <p>"Well, suppose I did? What then? I've part changed my flesh since that time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing
    we ARE loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this
    drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty red hair, but you couldn't get afire now. Shake yourself;
    you're Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat collar. Don't you see, then, that for
    these extra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask. But hark, again,
    and I'll answer ye the other thing. First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass
    the rope; now listen. What's the mighty difference between holding a mast's lightning-rod in the storm, and standing
    close by a mast that hasn't got any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don't you see, you timber-head, that no harm
    can come to the holder of the rod, unless the mast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship
    in a hundred carries rods, and Ahab,&mdash;aye, man, and all of us,&mdash;were in no more danger then, in my poor
    opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose you would
    have every man in the world go about with a small lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia
    officer's skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why don't ye be sensible, Flask? it's easy to be
    sensible; why don't ye, then? any man with half an eye can be sensible."</p>

    <p>"I don't know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard."</p>

    <p>"Yes, when a fellow's soaked through, it's hard to be sensible, that's a fact. And I am about drenched with this
    spray. Never mind; catch the turn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they
    were never going to be used again. Tying these two anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man's hands behind him.
    And what big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron fists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I
    wonder, Flask, whether the world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long cable, though.
    There, hammer that knot down, and we've done. So; next to touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory.
    I say, just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a
    Long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way, serve to carry off
    the water, d'ye see. Same with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and
    tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin
    overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly! This is a nasty night,
    lad."</p>
