    <p>Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension
    of Ahab's bodily strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for a time, lying all crushed in
    the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from
    him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.</p>

    <p>But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it. In an instant's compass,
    great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through
    feebler men's whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it,
    in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their
    pointless centres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.</p>

    <p>"The harpoon," said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on one bended arm&mdash;"is it safe?"</p>

    <p>"Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it," said Stubb, showing it.</p>

    <p>"Lay it before me;&mdash;any missing men?"</p>

    <p>"One, two, three, four, five;&mdash;there were five oars, sir, and here are five men."</p>

    <p>"That's good.&mdash;Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there! there! going to leeward still; what
    a leaping spout!&mdash;Hands off from me! The eternal sap runs up in Ahab's bones again! Set the sail; out oars; the
    helm!"</p>

    <p>It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked up by another boat, help to work that
    second boat; and the chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But the added
    power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin;
    swimming with a velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would
    prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long a period, such an
    unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship
    itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase.
    Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to their cranes&mdash;the two parts of the wrecked
    boat having been previously secured by her&mdash;and then hoisting everything to her side, and stacking her canvas
    high up, and sideways outstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod
    bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At the well known, methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was
    regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the
    time, and then pacing the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired, his
    voice was heard.&mdash;"Whose is the doubloon now? D'ye see him?" and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he
    commanded them to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon,
    unrestingly pacing the planks.</p>

    <p>As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still
    higher, or to spread one to a still greater breadth&mdash;thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at every
    turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken
    bow to shattered stern. At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds
    will sometimes sail across, so over the old man's face there now stole some such added gloom as this.</p>

    <p>Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus
    keep up a valiant place in his Captain's mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed&mdash;"The thistle the
    ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!"</p>

    <p>"What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did I not know thee brave as fearless fire
    (and as mechanical) I could swear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck."</p>

    <p>"Aye, sir," said Starbuck drawing near, "'tis a solemn sight; an omen, and an ill one."</p>

    <p>"Omen? omen?&mdash;the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to man, they will honourably speak
    outright; not shake their heads, and give an old wives' darkling hint.&mdash;Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles
    of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone
    among the millions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold&mdash;I shiver!&mdash;How now?
    Aloft there! D'ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he spout ten times a second!"</p>

    <p>The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling. Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out
    men still remained unset.</p>

    <p>"Can't see the spout now, sir;&mdash;too dark"&mdash;cried a voice from the air.</p>

    <p>"How heading when last seen?"</p>

    <p>"As before, sir,&mdash;straight to leeward."</p>

    <p>"Good! he will travel slower now 'tis night. Down royals and top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not
    run over him before morning; he's making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm there! keep her full before
    the wind!&mdash;Aloft! come down!&mdash;Mr. Stubb, send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till
    morning."&mdash;Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast&mdash;"Men, this gold is mine, for I earned it;
    but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him, upon the day
    he shall be killed, this gold is that man's; and if on that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its sum
    shall be divided among all of ye! Away now!&mdash;the deck is thine, sir!"</p>

    <p>And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and slouching his hat, stood there till dawn,
    except when at intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on.</p>

    <p>At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.</p>

    <p>"D'ye see him?" cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to spread.</p>

    <p>"See nothing, sir."</p>

    <p>"Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought for;&mdash;the top-gallant sails!&mdash;aye,
    they should have been kept on her all night. But no matter&mdash;'tis but resting for the rush."</p>
