    <p>Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin, leaving the strange captain transfixed at this
    unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment, Gardiner silently
    hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his boat, and returned to his ship.</p>

    <p>Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel was in view, she was seen to yaw hither
    and thither at every dark spot, however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung round; starboard
    and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all
    the while, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three tall cherry trees, when the boys are
    cherrying among the boughs.</p>

    <p>But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray,
    still remained without comfort. She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were not.</p>

    <p>(AHAB MOVING TO GO ON DECK; PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW.)</p>

    <p>"Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him,
    yet would not have thee by him. There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my malady. Like cures
    like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most desired health. Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve
    thee, as if thou wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair; another screw to it, thou
    must be."</p>

    <p>"No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir;
    I ask no more, so I remain a part of ye."</p>

    <p>"Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity of man!&mdash;and a black! and
    crazy!&mdash;but methinks like-cures-like applies to him too; he grows so sane again."</p>

    <p>"They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose drowned bones now show white, for all the
    blackness of his living skin. But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must go with ye."</p>

    <p>"If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab's purpose keels up in him. I tell thee no; it cannot be."</p>

    <p>"Oh good master, master, master!</p>

    <p>"Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad. Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory
    foot upon the deck, and still know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!&mdash;Met! True art thou, lad, as
    the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless thee; and if it come to that,&mdash;God for ever save thee,
    let what will befall."</p>

    <p>(AHAB GOES; PIP STEPS ONE STEP FORWARD.)</p>

    <p>"Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,&mdash;but I'm alone. Now were even poor Pip here I could endure
    it, but he's missing. Pip! Pip! Ding, dong, ding! Who's seen Pip? He must be up here; let's try the door. What?
    neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there's no opening it. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye,
    and told me this screwed chair was mine. Here, then, I'll seat me, against the transom, in the ship's full middle,
    all her keel and her three masts before me. Here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours great admirals
    sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants. Ha! what's this? epaulets! epaulets! the
    epaulets all come crowding! Pass round the decanters; glad to see ye; fill up, monsieurs! What an odd feeling, now,
    when a black boy's host to white men with gold lace upon their coats!&mdash;Monsieurs, have ye seen one Pip?&mdash;a
    little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and cowardly! Jumped from a whale-boat once;&mdash;seen him? No!
    Well then, fill up again, captains, and let's drink shame upon all cowards! I name no names. Shame upon them! Put
    one foot upon the table. Shame upon all cowards.&mdash;Hist! above there, I hear ivory&mdash;Oh, master! master! I
    am indeed down-hearted when you walk over me. But here I'll stay, though this stern strikes rocks; and they bulge
    through; and oysters come to join me."</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 130. The Hat.</h2>
    <p>And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a preliminary cruise, Ahab,&mdash;all other
    whaling waters swept&mdash;seemed to have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely there;
    now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted;
    now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick;&mdash;and now
    that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with
    which the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against; now it was that there lurked a something
    in the old man's eyes, which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting polar star, which
    through the livelong, arctic, six months' night sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab's purpose now
    fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It domineered above them so, that all their
    bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear or
    leaf.</p>

    <p>In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural, vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a
    smile; Starbuck no more strove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to finest dust, and
    powdered, for the time, in the clamped mortar of Ahab's iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the deck,
    ever conscious that the old man's despot eye was on them.</p>

    <p>But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when he thought no glance but one was on him;
    then you would have seen that even as Ahab's eyes so awed the crew's, the inscrutable Parsee's glance awed his; or
    somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it. Such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the
    thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious at him; half uncertain, as it
    seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen
    being's body. And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been
    known to slumber, or go below. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan but wondrous eyes
    did plainly say&mdash;We two watchmen never rest.</p>
