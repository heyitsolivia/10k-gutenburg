    <p>Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very ancient and interesting one, let us in
    some measure expatiate here. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians; because, in
    all my researches, I find none prior to them. For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless,
    by their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck
    was put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the dread gale of God's
    wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a
    nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general belief among archaeologists, that the first
    pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like formation
    of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers
    were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a
    sail, or a whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a
    lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food
    from the ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was
    not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to the
    last, literally died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and
    bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely incompetent to the business of
    singing out upon discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of Vendome,
    stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;
    whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering
    main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond
    which few mortals will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in Trafalgar
    Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where
    there is smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail from
    below, however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze; however it may
    be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what
    rocks must be shunned.</p>

    <p>It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers of the land with those of the sea; but
    that in truth it is not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian of Nantucket,
    stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly
    launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the
    look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this
    same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the
    ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper
    mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen
    taking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather of the
    tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. There you stand,
    a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath
    you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the
    boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing
    ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into
    languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news;
    read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you
    hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what
    you shall have for dinner&mdash;for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your
    bill of fare is immutable.</p>

    <p>In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years' voyage, as often happens, the sum of the
    various hours you spend at the mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that
    the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly
    destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling,
    such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small and
    snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t'
    gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t' gallant
    cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns.
    To be sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat; but properly
    speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its
    fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of
    perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as
    it is a mere envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body, and
    no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch-coat.</p>
