    <p>I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.
    After thinking some time on the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of
    the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel
    very cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer's not coming
    home at all that night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and
    then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.</p>

    <p>Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a
    good deal, and could not sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a
    good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come
    into the room from under the door.</p>

    <p>Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and
    resolved not to say a word till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the
    other, the stranger entered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me
    on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as
    being in the room. I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in
    unlacing the bag's mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round&mdash;when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a
    face! It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares. Yes,
    it's just as I thought, he's a terrible bedfellow; he's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just
    from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could
    not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first
    I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white
    man&mdash;a whaleman too&mdash;who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that this
    harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I,
    after all! It's only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly
    complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To
    be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white
    man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced
    these extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this
    harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it,
    and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest
    in the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head&mdash;a ghastly thing enough&mdash;and crammed it down
    into the bag. He now took off his hat&mdash;a new beaver hat&mdash;when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.
    There was no hair on his head&mdash;none to speak of at least&mdash;nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his
    forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood
    between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.</p>

    <p>Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was the second floor back. I am no
    coward, but what to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the
    parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much
    afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night. In fact, I was
    so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning
    what seemed inexplicable in him.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his chest and arms. As I live, these
    covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark
    squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.
    Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms.
    It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South
    Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too&mdash;perhaps the
    heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine&mdash;heavens! look at that tomahawk!</p>

    <p>But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my
    attention, and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught,
    which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed
    image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days' old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed
    head, at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing
    that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be
    nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and
    removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The
    chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate
    little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.</p>

    <p>I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at ease meantime&mdash;to see what was
    next to follow. First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully
    before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the
    shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals
    of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then
    blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did
    not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics were accompanied
    by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some
    pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing
    the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he
    were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.</p>
