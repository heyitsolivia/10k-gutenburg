    <p>So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while earnestly watching his motions, I
    seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that my free
    will had received a mortal wound; and that another's mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited
    disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity
    never could have so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering&mdash;while I jerked him now and then from
    between the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam him&mdash;still further pondering, I say, I saw that this
    situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he, one way or
    other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your
    apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may
    possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg's monkey-rope heedfully
    as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do
    what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*</p>

    <p>*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever
    tied together. This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to
    afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his
    monkey-rope holder.</p>

    <p>I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the ship&mdash;where he would
    occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was
    exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly
    allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass&mdash;the rabid creatures swarmed round it
    like bees in a beehive.</p>

    <p>And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet. A thing
    altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously
    carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but
    wise to look sharp to them. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow
    from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark&mdash;he was provided with still
    another protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over
    his head a couple of keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach. This
    procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg's best
    happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks
    were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating
    a leg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook&mdash;poor
    Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.</p>

    <p>Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every
    swell of the sea&mdash;what matters it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this
    whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and
    what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.</p>

    <p>But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the
    exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side; the
    steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance hands him&mdash;what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye
    gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!</p>

    <p>"Ginger? Do I smell ginger?" suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near. "Yes, this must be ginger," peering into the
    as yet untasted cup. Then standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished steward
    slowly saying, "Ginger? ginger? and will you have the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of
    ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal?
    Ginger!&mdash;what the devil is ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?&mdash;lucifer
    matches?&mdash;tinder?&mdash;gunpowder?&mdash;what the devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor
    Queequeg here."</p>

    <p>"There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this business," he suddenly added, now approaching
    Starbuck, who had just come from forward. "Will you look at that kannakin, sir; smell of it, if you please." Then
    watching the mate's countenance, he added, "The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap
    to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the
    sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?"</p>

    <p>"I trust not," said Starbuck, "it is poor stuff enough."</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye, steward," cried Stubb, "we'll teach you to drug a harpooneer; none of your apothecary's medicine here;
    you want to poison us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all, and pocket the
    proceeds, do ye?"</p>

    <p>"It was not me," cried Dough-Boy, "it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on board; and bade me never give
    the harpooneers any spirits, but only this ginger-jub&mdash;so she called it."</p>

    <p>"Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to the lockers, and get something better. I
    hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It is the captain's orders&mdash;grog for the harpooneer on a whale."</p>

    <p>"Enough," replied Starbuck, "only don't hit him again, but&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of that sort; and this fellow's a weazel.
    What were you about saying, sir?"</p>

    <p>"Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself."</p>

    <p>When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort of tea-caddy in the other. The first
    contained strong spirits, and was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity's gift, and that was freely given
    to the waves.</p>
