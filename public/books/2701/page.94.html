    <p>But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox
    of the sea, too fat to be delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the buffalo's (which
    is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy
    that is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too
    rich to supply a substitute for butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other
    substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip
    their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many a good supper have I thus made.</p>

    <p>In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish. The casket of the skull is broken into
    with an axe, and the two plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings), they are
    then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head, which is
    quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures, by continually
    dining upon calves' brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a calf's
    head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck
    with an intelligent looking calf's head before him, is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see. The head looks
    a sort of reproachfully at him, with an "Et tu Brute!" expression.</p>

    <p>It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating
    of him with abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before mentioned: i.e. that a
    man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man that
    ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he
    certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the meat-market of a Saturday
    night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight take a
    tooth out of the cannibal's jaw? Cannibals? who is not a cannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the
    Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that
    provident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese
    to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy pate-de-foie-gras.</p>

    <p>But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is adding insult to injury, is it? Look at your
    knife-handle, there, my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is that handle made
    of?&mdash;what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating? And what do you pick your teeth with,
    after devouring that fat goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill did the Secretary of the
    Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month or
    two that that society passed a resolution to patronise nothing but steel pens.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.</h2>
    <p>When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and weary toil, is brought alongside late at
    night, it is not, as a general thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in. For
    that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it.
    Therefore, the common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a'lee; and then send every one below to his
    hammock till daylight, with the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and
    two for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well.</p>

    <p>But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will not answer at all; because such
    incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a stretch,
    little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In most other parts of the ocean, however, where these
    fish do not so largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished, by vigorously
    stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to
    tickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod's sharks; though,
    to be sure, any man unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night, would have almost thought
    the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg
    and a forecastle seaman came on deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for immediately suspending
    the cutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the
    turbid sea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks,* by
    striking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy confusion of their
    mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not always hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of
    the incredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at each other's disembowelments, but like
    flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same
    mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was this all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and
    ghosts of these creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones,
    after what might be called the individual life had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,
    one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg's hand off, when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous
    jaw.</p>

    <p>*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel; is about the bigness of a man's spread
    hand; and in general shape, corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its sides are
    perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as
    possible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to
    thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.</p>
