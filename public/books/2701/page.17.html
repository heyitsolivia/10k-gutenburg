    <p>Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome, and by little and
    little we found ourselves sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the head-board with our
    four knees drawn up close together, and our two noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We
    felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that
    there was no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must
    be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself.
    If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to
    be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be
    slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm.
    For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious
    discomforts of the rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you
    and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an
    arctic crystal.</p>

    <p>We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at once I thought I would open my eyes; for
    when between sheets, whether by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always keeping my eyes
    shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity
    aright except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be
    more congenial to our clayey part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created
    darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o'clock-at-night, I experienced a
    disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a
    light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his
    Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before,
    yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than
    to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then. I no
    more felt unduly concerned for the landlord's policy of insurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential
    comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our
    shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of
    smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.</p>

    <p>Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes, I know not, but he now
    spoke of his native island; and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly complied.
    Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more
    familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere
    skeleton I give.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 12. Biographical.</h2>
    <p>Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and South. It is not down in any map; true
    places never are.</p>

    <p>When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout, followed by the nibbling
    goats, as if he were a green sapling; even then, in Queequeg's ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire to see
    something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High
    Priest; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors. There was excellent
    blood in his veins&mdash;royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his
    untutored youth.</p>

    <p>A Sag Harbor ship visited his father's bay, and Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands. But the ship,
    having her full complement of seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father's influence could prevail.
    But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass
    through when she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with
    mangrove thickets that grew out into the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its prow
    seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out;
    gained her side; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing
    himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in
    pieces.</p>

    <p>In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was
    the son of a King, and Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit
    Christendom, the captain at last relented, and told him he might make himself at home. But this fine young
    savage&mdash;this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain's cabin. They put him down among the sailors, and made
    a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no
    seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at
    bottom&mdash;so he told me&mdash;he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts
    whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more than that, still better than they were. But, alas!
    the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely
    more so, than all his father's heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there;
    and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also, poor Queequeg gave it up
    for lost. Thought he, it's a wicked world in all meridians; I'll die a pagan.</p>

    <p>And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk
    their gibberish. Hence the queer ways about him, though now some time from home.</p>
