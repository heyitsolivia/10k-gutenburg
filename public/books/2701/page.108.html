    <p>In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the
    full front of his head. This aspect is sublime.</p>

    <p>In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the morning. In the repose of the pasture, the
    curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the elephant's
    brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors to
    their decrees. It signifies&mdash;"God: done this day by my hand." But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very
    often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which like
    Shakespeare's or Melancthon's rise so high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal,
    tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the forehead's wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts
    descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale,
    this high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in that
    full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living
    nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no
    face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering
    with the doom of boats, and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that way
    viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic
    depression in the forehead's middle, which, in man, is Lavater's mark of genius.</p>

    <p>But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a book, spoken a speech? No, his great
    genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence.
    And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified
    by their child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the
    Sperm Whale has no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion. If hereafter
    any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and
    livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove's
    high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.</p>

    <p>Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of
    every man's and every being's face. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing fable. If then,
    Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could not read the simplest peasant's face in its profounder and
    more subtle meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale's brow? I but put
    that brow before you. Read it if you can.</p>

    <p>If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle
    which it is impossible to square.</p>

    <p>In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the
    side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base. But in
    life&mdash;as we have elsewhere seen&mdash;this inclined plane is angularly filled up, and almost squared by the
    enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the
    mass; while under the long floor of this crater&mdash;in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as
    many in depth&mdash;reposes the mere handful of this monster's brain. The brain is at least twenty feet from his
    apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the
    amplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen
    who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the
    cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it
    seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his
    intelligence.</p>

    <p>It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in the creature's living intact state, is an
    entire delusion. As for his true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The whale, like all
    things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common world.</p>

    <p>If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end, which is the high end, you
    will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from the same point of view.
    Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down to the human magnitude) among a plate of men's skulls, and you would
    involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological
    phrase you would say&mdash;This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations, considered along
    with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the
    most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.</p>

    <p>But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale's proper brain, you deem it incapable of being adequately
    charted, then I have another idea for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped's spine, you will be
    struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental
    resemblance to the skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls. But
    the curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once
    pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying, in a
    sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an
    important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that
    much of a man's character will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel your spine than your skull,
    whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in the
    firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world.</p>
