    <p>But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the
    crew, though still as it were somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery
    to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself
    to be linked with Ahab's peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence; Heaven
    knows, but it might have been even authority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an indifferent air
    concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their
    dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities,
    especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent&mdash;those insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries,
    which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth's primal generations,
    when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came,
    eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end; when
    though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the
    uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.</h2>
    <p>Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly swept across four several cruising-grounds;
    that off the Azores; off the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata;
    and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality, southerly from St. Helena.</p>

    <p>It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night, when all the waves rolled
    by like scrolls of silver; and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence, not a
    solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by
    the moon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea. Fedallah first descried
    this jet. For of these moonlight nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a look-out there,
    with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet, though herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman
    in a hundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old
    Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But when, after
    spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when, after all
    this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started
    to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. "There she blows!" Had
    the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For
    though it was a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously exciting, that almost every
    soul on board instinctively desired a lowering.</p>

    <p>Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the t'gallant sails and royals to be set, and
    every stunsail spread. The best man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head manned, the piled-up
    craft rolled down before the wind. The strange, upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the
    hollows of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet; while still she rushed
    along, as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her&mdash;one to mount direct to heaven, the other to
    drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched Ahab's face that night, you would have thought that in
    him also two different things were warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck, every stroke
    of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly
    sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that
    night. Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.</p>

    <p>This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days after, lo! at the same silent hour, it
    was again announced: again it was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it disappeared as
    if it had never been. And so it served us night after night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously
    jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be; disappearing again for one whole day, or two
    days, or three; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our
    van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.</p>

    <p>Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with the preternaturalness, as it seemed,
    which in many things invested the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever
    descried; at however remote times, or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast
    by one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this
    flitting apparition, as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the monster might turn round
    upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas.</p>

    <p>These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of
    the weather, in which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for days and
    days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful
    errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.</p>

    <p>But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the
    long, troubled seas that are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and gored the dark
    waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this
    desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than before.</p>

    <p>Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us; while thick in our rear flew
    the inscrutable sea-ravens. And every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and spite of our
    hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited
    craft; a thing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves. And heaved and
    heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great mundane soul
    were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred.</p>
