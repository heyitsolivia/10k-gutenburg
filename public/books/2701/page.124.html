    <p>Is it not a saying in every one's mouth, Possession is half of the law: that is, regardless of how the thing came
    into possession? But often possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of Russian serfs and
    Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the
    widow's last mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain's marble mansion with a door-plate for a waif;
    what is that but a Fast-Fish? What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor Woebegone, the
    bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone's family from starvation; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What
    is the Archbishop of Savesoul's income of L100,000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands
    of broken-backed laborers (all sure of heaven without any of Savesoul's help) what is that globular L100,000 but a
    Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder's hereditary towns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted
    harpooneer, John Bull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic lancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas
    but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all these, is not Possession the whole of the law?</p>

    <p>But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more
    widely so. That is internationally and universally applicable.</p>

    <p>What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the Spanish standard by way of waifing it for
    his royal master and mistress? What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What India to England? What at
    last will Mexico be to the United States? All Loose-Fish.</p>

    <p>What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but Loose-Fish? What all men's minds and opinions but
    Loose-Fish? What is the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to the ostentatious smuggling
    verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose-Fish? What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And what
    are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.</h2>
    <p>"De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam." BRACTON, L. 3, C. 3.</p>

    <p>Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the context, means, that of all whales
    captured by anybody on the coast of that land, the King, as Honourary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head, and the
    Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division which, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there
    is no intermediate remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to this day in force in England; and as it
    offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is here treated of
    in a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a
    separate car, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first place, in curious proof of the fact
    that the above-mentioned law is still in force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the
    last two years.</p>

    <p>It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase
    succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore. Now the
    Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden.
    Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port
    territories become by assignment his. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But not so. Because the Lord
    Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing
    of them.</p>

    <p>Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs,
    had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good L150 from the precious oil and bone; and
    in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their respective
    shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his
    arm; and laying it upon the whale's head, he says&mdash;"Hands off! this fish, my masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize
    it as the Lord Warden's." Upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternation&mdash;so truly
    English&mdash;knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round; meanwhile ruefully
    glancing from the whale to the stranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the hard heart of
    the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At length one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas,
    made bold to speak,</p>

    <p>"Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?"</p>

    <p>"The Duke."</p>

    <p>"But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?"</p>

    <p>"It is his."</p>

    <p>"We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all that to go to the Duke's benefit; we
    getting nothing at all for our pains but our blisters?"</p>

    <p>"It is his."</p>

    <p>"Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood?"</p>

    <p>"It is his."</p>

    <p>"I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of this whale."</p>

    <p>"It is his."</p>

    <p>"Won't the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?"</p>

    <p>"It is his."</p>

    <p>In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of Wellington received the money. Thinking that
    viewed in some particular lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed, under the
    circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace,
    begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To which my Lord Duke in
    substance replied (both letters were published) that he had already done so, and received the money, and would be
    obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend gentleman) would decline meddling with other
    people's business. Is this the still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands
    coercing alms of beggars?</p>

    <p>It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the
    Sovereign. We must needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that right. The
    law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon gives us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught
    belongs to the King and Queen, "because of its superior excellence." And by the soundest commentators this has ever
    been held a cogent argument in such matters.</p>
