    <p>Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck, unless Ahab was before them; either
    standing in his pivot-hole, or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,&mdash;the main-mast and the
    mizen; or else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle,&mdash;his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to
    step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he stood, however the days and nights were
    added on, that he had not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never tell
    unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at times; or whether he was still intently scanning
    them; no matter, though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp
    gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day's
    sunshine dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath the planks; whatever
    he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.</p>

    <p>He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,&mdash;breakfast and dinner: supper he never touched;
    nor reaped his beard; which darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow idly
    on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck;
    and though the Parsee's mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these two never seemed to
    speak&mdash;one man to the other&mdash;unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary.
    Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck crew, they seemed
    pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the
    slightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood far parted in the
    starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the
    Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance.</p>

    <p>And yet, somehow, did Ahab&mdash;in his own proper self, as daily, hourly, and every instant, commandingly
    revealed to his subordinates,&mdash;Ahab seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both
    seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee
    what he may, all rib and keel was solid Ahab.</p>

    <p>At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard from aft,&mdash;"Man the
    mast-heads!"&mdash;and all through the day, till after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the
    striking of the helmsman's bell, was heard&mdash;"What d'ye see?&mdash;sharp! sharp!"</p>

    <p>But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been
    seen; the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew's fidelity; at least, of nearly all except the Pagan
    harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But
    if these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them, however his actions
    might seem to hint them.</p>

    <p>"I will have the first sight of the whale myself,"&mdash;he said. "Aye! Ahab must have the doubloon! and with his
    own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block, to secure to
    the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a
    pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that end yet in his hand and standing
    beside the pin, he looked round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo,
    Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate,
    said,&mdash;"Take the rope, sir&mdash;I give it into thy hands, Starbuck." Then arranging his person in the basket,
    he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and
    afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for
    miles and miles,&mdash;ahead, astern, this side, and that,&mdash;within the wide expanded circle commanded at so
    great a height.</p>

    <p>When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging, which chances to afford no
    foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these circumstances,
    its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because
    in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly
    discerned by what is seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes
    cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the
    hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea. So Ahab's
    proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost
    the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to
    decision&mdash;one of those too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;&mdash;it was
    strange, that this was the very man he should select for his watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an
    otherwise distrusted person's hands.</p>

    <p>Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten minutes; one of those red-billed savage
    sea-hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these latitudes; one of
    these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a
    thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and went eddying again round his head.</p>

    <p>But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed,
    would any one else have marked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least heedful eye
    seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight.</p>

    <p>"Your hat, your hat, sir!" suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood
    directly behind Ahab, though somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing them.</p>

    <p>But already the sable wing was before the old man's eyes; the long hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the
    black hawk darted away with his prize.</p>
