    <p>The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of oil, formed by the crossing and
    recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent. The
    upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous
    great tierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale's vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices
    for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the
    most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all
    his oily vintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous state. Nor
    is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly
    fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline
    shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale's case generally yields about
    five hundred gallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and
    dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can.</p>

    <p>I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated within, but in superlative richness
    that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like the lining of a fine
    pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale's case.</p>

    <p>It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the entire length of the entire top
    of the head; and since&mdash;as has been elsewhere set forth&mdash;the head embraces one third of the whole length
    of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six
    feet for the depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship's side.</p>

    <p>As in decapitating the whale, the operator's instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is
    subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless,
    untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated
    end of the head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by the enormous
    cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter.</p>

    <p>Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and&mdash;in this particular
    instance&mdash;almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whale's great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.</h2>
    <p>Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect posture, runs straight out upon the
    overhanging mainyard-arm, to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried with him a
    light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts, travelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this
    block, so that it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it is caught and firmly held by
    a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he
    lands on the summit of the head. There&mdash;still high elevated above the rest of the company, to whom he
    vivaciously cries&mdash;he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A
    short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into
    the Tun. In this business he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house, sounding the walls
    to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time this cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely
    like a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other end, being stretched across the deck,
    is there held by two or three alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian, to whom
    another person has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the
    bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up comes the
    bucket again, all bubbling like a dairy-maid's pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the
    full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly emptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft,
    it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram
    his long pole harder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone
    down.</p>

    <p>Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way; several tubs had been filled with the
    fragrant sperm; when all at once a queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian, was so
    heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head;
    or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One himself would have it to
    fall out so, without stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but, on a sudden,
    as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up&mdash;my God! poor Tashtego&mdash;like the twin reciprocating
    bucket in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily
    gurgling, went clean out of sight!</p>

    <p>"Man overboard!" cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first came to his senses. "Swing the bucket
    this way!" and putting one foot into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself, the
    hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom.
    Meantime, there was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and
    heaving just below the surface of the sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only
    the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk.</p>

    <p>At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing the whip&mdash;which had somehow got foul
    of the great cutting tackles&mdash;a sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all, one of
    the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung,
    till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook, upon which the entire
    strain now depended, seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the
    violent motions of the head.</p>
