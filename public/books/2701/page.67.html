    <p>Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange, long drawn, and musically wild and
    unearthly, that the ball of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice
    dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly
    forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the
    same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen's look-outs perched
    as high in the air; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence
    as from Tashtego the Indian's.</p>

    <p>As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would
    have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing their
    coming.</p>

    <p>"There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!"</p>

    <p>"Where-away?"</p>

    <p>"On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!"</p>

    <p>Instantly all was commotion.</p>

    <p>The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen
    distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus.</p>

    <p>"There go flukes!" was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales disappeared.</p>

    <p>"Quick, steward!" cried Ahab. "Time! time!"</p>

    <p>Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact minute to Ahab.</p>

    <p>The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling before it. Tashtego reporting that the
    whales had gone down heading to leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows.
    For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when, sounding with his head in one direction, he
    nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the opposite
    quarter&mdash;this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish
    seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of the men selected for
    shipkeepers&mdash;that is, those not appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head.
    The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust
    out; the mainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs.
    Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on
    the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war's men about to throw themselves on board an enemy's ship.</p>

    <p>But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale. With a start all
    glared at dark Ahab, who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.</p>

    <p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.</h2>
    <p>The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of the deck, and, with a noiseless
    celerity, were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always been deemed
    one of the spare boats, though technically called the captain's, on account of its hanging from the starboard
    quarter. The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white tooth evilly protruding from its
    steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers of the
    same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided
    and coiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid,
    tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;&mdash;a race notorious for a
    certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret
    confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.</p>

    <p>While yet the wondering ship's company were gazing upon these strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old
    man at their head, "All ready there, Fedallah?"</p>

    <p>"Ready," was the half-hissed reply.</p>

    <p>"Lower away then; d'ye hear?" shouting across the deck. "Lower away there, I say."</p>

    <p>Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail; the sheaves
    whirled round in the blocks; with a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous,
    off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship's side into
    the tossed boats below.</p>

    <p>Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship's lee, when a fourth keel, coming from the windward side, pulled
    round under the stern, and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly hailed
    Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with all their
    eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command.</p>

    <p>"Captain Ahab?&mdash;" said Starbuck.</p>

    <p>"Spread yourselves," cried Ahab; "give way, all four boats. Thou, Flask, pull out more to leeward!"</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye, sir," cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his great steering oar. "Lay back!" addressing
    his crew. "There!&mdash;there!&mdash;there again! There she blows right ahead, boys!&mdash;lay back!"</p>

    <p>"Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy."</p>

    <p>"Oh, I don't mind'em, sir," said Archy; "I knew it all before now. Didn't I hear 'em in the hold? And didn't I
    tell Cabaco here of it? What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask."</p>

    <p>"Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little ones," drawlingly and soothingly sighed
    Stubb to his crew, some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness. "Why don't you break your backbones, my boys? What
    is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They are only five more hands come to help us&mdash;never mind
    from where&mdash;the more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone&mdash;devils are good fellows
    enough. So, so; there you are now; that's the stroke for a thousand pounds; that's the stroke to sweep the stakes!
    Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men&mdash;all hearts alive! Easy, easy; don't be in a
    hurry&mdash;don't be in a hurry. Why don't you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so,
    then:&mdash;softly, softly! That's it&mdash;that's it! long and strong. Give way there, give way! The devil fetch
    ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull, can't
    ye? pull, won't ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don't ye pull?&mdash;pull and break something!
    pull, and start your eyes out! Here!" whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; "every mother's son of ye draw
    his knife, and pull with the blade between his teeth. That's it&mdash;that's it. Now ye do something; that looks
    like it, my steel-bits. Start her&mdash;start her, my silver-spoons! Start her, marling-spikes!"</p>
