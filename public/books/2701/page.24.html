    <p>"What do ye think of him, Bildad?" said Peleg.</p>

    <p>"He'll do," said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite
    audible.</p>

    <p>I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a
    blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the
    ship's articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high
    time to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in
    the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the
    profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective
    duties of the ship's company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very
    large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt
    that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay&mdash;that is, the 275th part of the clear net
    proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a
    rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the
    clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which I would not have to pay
    one stiver.</p>

    <p>It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortune&mdash;and so it was, a very poor
    way indeed. But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is
    ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought
    that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th,
    considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.</p>

    <p>But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits
    was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they
    being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,
    left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old
    Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,
    quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying
    to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was such an interested
    party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, "LAY not up for
    yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Well, Captain Bildad," interrupted Peleg, "what d'ye say, what lay shall we give this young man?"</p>

    <p>"Thou knowest best," was the sepulchral reply, "the seven hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would
    it?&mdash;'where moth and rust do corrupt, but LAY&mdash;'"</p>

    <p>LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are
    determined that I, for one, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an
    exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman,
    yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet,
    when you come to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-seventh part of a
    farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.</p>

    <p>"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad," cried Peleg, "thou dost not want to swindle this young man! he must have more
    than that."</p>

    <p>"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh," again said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then went on
    mumbling&mdash;"for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."</p>

    <p>"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth," said Peleg, "do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth
    lay, I say."</p>

    <p>Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, "Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but
    thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship&mdash;widows and orphans, many of
    them&mdash;and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those
    widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg."</p>

    <p>"Thou Bildad!" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin. "Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had
    followed thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to
    founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn."</p>

    <p>"Captain Peleg," said Bildad steadily, "thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I
    can't tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a
    leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg."</p>

    <p>"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It's an all-fired outrage to
    tell any human creature that he's bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my
    soul-bolts, but I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;yes, I'll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the
    cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun&mdash;a straight wake with ye!"</p>

    <p>As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for
    that time eluded him.</p>

    <p>Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half
    a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside
    from the door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened
    wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the
    slightest intention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after
    letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he
    twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. "Whew!" he whistled at last&mdash;"the squall's gone off to
    leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here
    needs the grindstone. That's he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye say? Well
    then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay."</p>
