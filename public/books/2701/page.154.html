    <p>As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed
    meant for Ahab, and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself&mdash;these passed over the mute, motionless
    Parsee's face. Unobserved he rose and glided away; while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen
    clustered together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck, shouted out&mdash;"To the braces! Up
    helm!&mdash;square in!"</p>

    <p>In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon her heel, her three firm-seated graceful
    masts erectly poised upon her long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient
    steed.</p>

    <p>Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod's tumultuous way, and Ahab's also, as he went
    lurching along the deck.</p>

    <p>"I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full of its tormented flaming life; and I have
    seen it wane at last, down, down, to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of thine, what will at
    length remain but one little heap of ashes!"</p>

    <p>"Aye," cried Stubb, "but sea-coal ashes&mdash;mind ye that, Mr. Starbuck&mdash;sea-coal, not your common
    charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab mutter, 'Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine; swears
    that I must play them, and no others.' And damn me, Ahab, but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in
    it!"</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 119. The Candles.</h2>
    <p>Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure.
    Skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame
    northern lands. So, too, it is, that in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all
    storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and
    sleepy town.</p>

    <p>Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which
    had struck her directly ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the thunder, and blazed with
    the lightning, that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
    tempest had left for its after sport.</p>

    <p>Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft,
    to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb and Flask were directing
    the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats. But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted to
    the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab's) did not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up
    against the reeling ship's high teetering side, stove in the boat's bottom at the stern, and left it again, all
    dripping through like a sieve.</p>

    <p>"Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck," said Stubb, regarding the wreck, "but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for
    one, can't fight it. You see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps, all round the world
    it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me, all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here.
    But never mind; it's all in fun: so the old song says;"&mdash;(SINGS.)</p>

    <pre xml:space="preserve">Oh! jolly is the gale, And a joker is the whale, A' flourishin' his tail,&mdash; Such a
    funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh! The scud all a flyin', That's his flip only
    foamin'; When he stirs in the spicin',&mdash; Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean,
    oh! Thunder splits the ships, But he only smacks his lips, A tastin' of this flip,&mdash; Such a funny, sporty,
    gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!</pre>
    <p>"Avast Stubb," cried Starbuck, "let the Typhoon sing, and strike his harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a
    brave man thou wilt hold thy peace."</p>

    <p>"But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward; and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I
    tell you what it is, Mr. Starbuck, there's no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat. And when
    that's done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a wind-up."</p>

    <p>"Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own."</p>

    <p>"What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never mind how foolish?"</p>

    <p>"Here!" cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his hand towards the weather bow, "markest
    thou not that the gale comes from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the very course he
    swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where is that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to
    stand&mdash;his stand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou must!</p>

    <p>"I don't half understand ye: what's in the wind?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket," soliloquized Starbuck suddenly,
    heedless of Stubb's question. "The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it into a fair wind that
    will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward, all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward&mdash;I see it
    lightens up there; but not with the lightning."</p>

    <p>At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following the flashes, a voice was heard at his
    side; and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.</p>

    <p>"Who's there?"</p>

    <p>"Old Thunder!" said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path
    made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire.</p>

    <p>Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil; so the
    kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But as this
    conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if
    kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering not a little with some of the
    rigging, and more or less impeding the vessel's way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a ship's
    lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made in long slender links, so as to be the more readily
    hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.</p>

    <p>"The rods! the rods!" cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that
    had just been darting flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. "Are they overboard? drop them over, fore and aft.
    Quick!"</p>
