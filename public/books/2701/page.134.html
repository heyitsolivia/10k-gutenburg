    <p>"No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil's claws must have left their mouldings there since
    yesterday," murmured Starbuck to himself, leaning against the bulwarks. "The old man seems to read Belshazzar's
    awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly. He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three
    mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death,
    God girds us round; and over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope. If we bend
    down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way,
    to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from
    him, we gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will quit it, lest
    Truth shake me falsely."</p>

    <p>"There now's the old Mogul," soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, "he's been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck
    from the same, and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long. And all from
    looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer's Hook, I'd not look at it very long
    ere spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as queer. I have seen doubloons before now
    in my voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of
    Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter
    joes. What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me
    read it once. Halloa! here's signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the
    zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. I'll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with
    Daboll's arithmetic, I'll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts
    calendar. Here's the book. Let's see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he's always among 'em. Hem, hem, hem; here
    they are&mdash;here they go&mdash;all alive:&mdash;Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! here's Gemini
    himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among 'em. Aye, here on the coin he's just crossing the threshold
    between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your
    places. You'll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That's my small
    experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch's navigator, and Daboll's arithmetic go. Signs and
    wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders! There's a clue somewhere; wait
    a bit; hist&mdash;hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round
    chapter; and now I'll read it off, straight out of the book. Come, Almanack! To begin: there's Aries, or the
    Ram&mdash;lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull&mdash;he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or
    the Twins&mdash;that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back;
    and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path&mdash;he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs
    with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that's our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye,
    when pop comes Libra, or the Scales&mdash;happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we are very sad about that,
    Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang
    come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside!
    here's the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when
    Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes,
    we sleep. There's a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it
    all alive and hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb.
    Oh, jolly's the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works,
    now, and let's hear what he'll have to say. There; he's before it; he'll out with something presently. So, so; he's
    beginning."</p>

    <p>"I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a certain whale, this round thing belongs
    to him. So, what's all this staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that's true; and at two cents the
    cigar, that's nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won't smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here's
    nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy 'em out."</p>

    <p>"Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a foolish look to it; yet, if it be really
    foolish, then has it a sort of wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman&mdash;the old
    hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and
    goes round on the other side of the mast; why, there's a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he's back again;
    what does that mean? Hark! he's muttering&mdash;voice like an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and
    listen!"</p>

    <p>"If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when the sun stands in some one of these signs.
    I've studied signs, and know their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch in Copenhagen.
    Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what's
    the horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe sign&mdash;the roaring and devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old
    head shakes to think of thee."</p>

    <p>"There's another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in one kind of world, you see. Dodge again!
    here comes Queequeg&mdash;all tattooing&mdash;looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the Cannibal? As
    I live he's comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone; thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the
    bowels, I suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon's Astronomy in the back country. And by Jove, he's found something
    there in the vicinity of his thigh&mdash;I guess it's Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don't know what to make of
    the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king's trowsers. But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil,
    Fedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual. What does he say, with that
    look of his? Ah, only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the coin&mdash;fire worshipper,
    depend upon it. Ho! more and more. This way comes Pip&mdash;poor boy! would he had died, or I; he's half horrible to
    me. He too has been watching all of these interpreters&mdash;myself included&mdash;and look now, he comes to read,
    with that unearthly idiot face. Stand away again and hear him. Hark!"</p>
