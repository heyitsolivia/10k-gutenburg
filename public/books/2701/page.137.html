    <p>"Oh!" cried the one-armed captain, "oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we didn't see him again for some time; in
    fact, as I before hinted, I didn't then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till some time
    afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby Dick&mdash;as some call him&mdash;and then I knew it
    was he."</p>

    <p>"Did'st thou cross his wake again?"</p>

    <p>"Twice."</p>

    <p>"But could not fasten?"</p>

    <p>"Didn't want to try to: ain't one limb enough? What should I do without this other arm? And I'm thinking Moby
    Dick doesn't bite so much as he swallows."</p>

    <p>"Well, then," interrupted Bunger, "give him your left arm for bait to get the right. Do you know,
    gentlemen"&mdash;very gravely and mathematically bowing to each Captain in succession&mdash;"Do you know, gentlemen,
    that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite
    impossible for him to completely digest even a man's arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the White
    Whale's malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by
    feints. But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe
    swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth
    or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d'ye see. No possible way for him to digest
    that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick
    enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other,
    why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you shortly, that's all."</p>

    <p>"No, thank ye, Bunger," said the English Captain, "he's welcome to the arm he has, since I can't help it, and
    didn't know him then; but not to another one. No more White Whales for me; I've lowered for him once, and that has
    satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in
    him, but, hark ye, he's best let alone; don't you think so, Captain?"&mdash;glancing at the ivory leg.</p>

    <p>"He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let alone, that accursed thing is not always what
    least allures. He's all a magnet! How long since thou saw'st him last? Which way heading?"</p>

    <p>"Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend's," cried Bunger, stoopingly walking round Ahab, and like a dog,
    strangely snuffing; "this man's blood&mdash;bring the thermometer!&mdash;it's at the boiling point!&mdash;his pulse
    makes these planks beat!&mdash;sir!"&mdash;taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing near to Ahab's arm.</p>

    <p>"Avast!" roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks&mdash;"Man the boat! Which way heading?"</p>

    <p>"Good God!" cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put. "What's the matter? He was heading east, I
    think.&mdash;Is your Captain crazy?" whispering Fedallah.</p>

    <p>But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to take the boat's steering oar, and Ahab,
    swinging the cutting-tackle towards him, commanded the ship's sailors to stand by to lower.</p>

    <p>In a moment he was standing in the boat's stern, and the Manilla men were springing to their oars. In vain the
    English Captain hailed him. With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood upright
    till alongside of the Pequod.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 101. The Decanter.</h2>
    <p>Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she hailed from London, and was named after the
    late Samuel Enderby, merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby &amp; Sons; a house
    which in my poor whaleman's opinion, comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in
    point of real historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in
    existence, my numerous fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out the first English
    ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our
    valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the
    North and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were the first among
    mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were the only people
    of the whole globe who so harpooned him.</p>

    <p>In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and at the sole charge of the vigorous
    Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the
    great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the
    precious sperm, the Amelia's example was soon followed by other ships, English and American, and thus the vast Sperm
    Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable house again
    bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons&mdash;how many, their mother only knows&mdash;and under their immediate
    auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler
    on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling
    voyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted
    out a discovery whale ship of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan. That
    ship&mdash;well called the "Syren"&mdash;made a noble experimental cruise; and it was thus that the great Japanese
    Whaling Ground first became generally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin, a
    Nantucketer.</p>

    <p>All honour to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to the present day; though doubtless the
    original Samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world.</p>

    <p>The ship named after him was worthy of the honour, being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way. I
    boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the forecastle. It was
    a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps&mdash;every soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And
    that fine gam I had&mdash;long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel&mdash;it minds me of
    the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever
    lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when
    the squall came (for it's squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands&mdash;visitors and all&mdash;were called to
    reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the
    skirts of our jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling gale, a warning example to
    all drunken tars. However, the masts did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to
    pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and
    pickled it to my taste.</p>
