    <p>"Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such a day&mdash;very much such a sweetness as
    this&mdash;I struck my first whale&mdash;a boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty&mdash;forty&mdash;forty years
    ago!&mdash;ago! Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and storm-time! forty years
    on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors
    of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore. When I think of this
    life I have led; the desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a Captain's exclusiveness,
    which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without&mdash;oh, weariness! heaviness!
    Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command!&mdash;when I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so keenly known
    to me before&mdash;and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare&mdash;fit emblem of the dry nourishment
    of my soil!&mdash;when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and broken the world's fresh
    bread to my mouldy crusts&mdash;away, whole oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed
    for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow&mdash;wife? wife?&mdash;rather a widow with
    her husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the frenzy,
    the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly
    chased his prey&mdash;more a demon than a man!&mdash;aye, aye! what a forty years' fool&mdash;fool&mdash;old fool,
    has old Ahab been! Why this strife of the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the
    lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load I bear,
    one poor leg should have been snatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to
    weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I
    feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise.
    God! God! God!&mdash;crack my heart!&mdash;stave my brain!&mdash;mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey
    hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably old? Close! stand close to me,
    Starbuck; let me look into a human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to gaze upon God. By
    the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye.
    No, no; stay on board, on board!&mdash;lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick. That hazard
    shall not be thine. No, no! not with the far away home I see in that eye!"</p>

    <p>"Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all! why should any one give chase to that hated
    fish! Away with me! let us fly these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are Starbuck's&mdash;wife and
    child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,
    longing, paternal old age! Away! let us away!&mdash;this instant let me alter the course! How cheerily, how
    hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl on our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some such
    mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket."</p>

    <p>"They have, they have. I have seen them&mdash;some summer days in the morning. About this time&mdash;yes, it is
    his noon nap now&mdash;the boy vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of cannibal old
    me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back to dance him again."</p>

    <p>"'Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every morning, should be carried to the hill to catch
    the first glimpse of his father's sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for Nantucket! Come, my Captain,
    study out the course, and let us away! See, see! the boy's face from the window! the boy's hand on the hill!"</p>

    <p>But Ahab's glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and cast his last, cindered apple to the
    soil.</p>

    <p>"What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel,
    remorseless emperor commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and crowding, and
    jamming myself on all the time; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not
    so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm? But if the great sun move not of himself;
    but is as an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible power; how then can this
    one small heart beat; this one small brain think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does
    that living, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate
    is the handspike. And all the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon Albicore! who put it
    into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where do murderers go, man! Who's to doom, when the judge himself is
    dragged to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and the air smells now, as if it blew from
    a far-away meadow; they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the mowers are
    sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye,
    and rust amid greenness; as last year's scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut swaths&mdash;Starbuck!"</p>

    <p>But blanched to a corpse's hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.</p>

    <p>Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at two reflected, fixed eyes in the water
    there. Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 133. The Chase&mdash;First Day.</h2>
    <p>That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man&mdash;as his wont at intervals&mdash;stepped forth from the
    scuttle in which he leaned, and went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing up the
    sea air as a sagacious ship's dog will, in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be
    near. Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale, was palpable to
    all the watch; nor was any mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane, and then
    ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship's course to be
    slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.</p>
