    <p>But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my
    harpooneer.</p>

    <p>"Landlord!" said I, "what sort of a chap is he&mdash;does he always keep such late hours?" It was now hard upon
    twelve o'clock.</p>

    <p>The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my
    comprehension. "No," he answered, "generally he's an early bird&mdash;airley to bed and airley to rise&mdash;yes,
    he's the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth
    keeps him so late, unless, may be, he can't sell his head."</p>

    <p>"Can't sell his head?&mdash;What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me?" getting into a
    towering rage. "Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday
    night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?"</p>

    <p>"That's precisely it," said the landlord, "and I told him he couldn't sell it here, the market's
    overstocked."</p>

    <p>"With what?" shouted I.</p>

    <p>"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?"</p>

    <p>"I tell you what it is, landlord," said I quite calmly, "you'd better stop spinning that yarn to me&mdash;I'm not
    green."</p>

    <p>"May be not," taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, "but I rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere
    harpooneer hears you a slanderin' his head."</p>

    <p>"I'll break it for him," said I, now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the
    landlord's.</p>

    <p>"It's broke a'ready," said he.</p>

    <p>"Broke," said I&mdash;"BROKE, do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess."</p>

    <p>"Landlord," said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a snow-storm&mdash;"landlord, stop whittling. You and
    I must understand one another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can
    only give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have
    not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an
    uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow&mdash;a sort of connexion, landlord, which is
    an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what
    this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him. And in the first place,
    you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good evidence that
    this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean, landlord, YOU,
    sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal
    prosecution."</p>

    <p>"Wall," said the landlord, fetching a long breath, "that's a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now
    and then. But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just arrived from the south
    seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but
    one, and that one he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin' human
    heads about the streets when folks is goin' to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was
    goin' out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions."</p>

    <p>This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed that the landlord, after all, had had no
    idea of fooling me&mdash;but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night
    clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?</p>

    <p>"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man."</p>

    <p>"He pays reg'lar," was the rejoinder. "But come, it's getting dreadful late, you had better be turning
    flukes&mdash;it's a nice bed; Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There's plenty of room for
    two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty big bed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and
    little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on
    the floor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do. Come along here, I'll give ye a glim
    in a jiffy;" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way. But I stood
    irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed "I vum it's Sunday&mdash;you won't see that
    harpooneer to-night; he's come to anchor somewhere&mdash;come along then; DO come; WON'T ye come?"</p>

    <p>I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a
    clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep
    abreast.</p>

    <p>"There," said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and
    centre table; "there, make yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye." I turned round from eyeing the bed, but
    he had disappeared.</p>

    <p>Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny
    tolerably well. I then glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other
    furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man
    striking a whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the
    floor in one corner; also a large seaman's bag, containing the harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land
    trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall
    harpoon standing at the head of the bed.</p>

    <p>But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried
    every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing but a large
    door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an
    Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.
    But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any
    Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly
    shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy
    day. I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore
    myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.</p>
