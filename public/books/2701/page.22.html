    <p>Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in order to propose myself as a
    candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather
    wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical
    shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest
    part of the jaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced
    together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres
    waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem's head. A triangular opening faced towards the
    bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.</p>

    <p>And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and
    who, it being noon, and the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was
    seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed
    of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.</p>

    <p>There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and
    brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a
    fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen
    from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;&mdash;for this causes the muscles
    about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.</p>

    <p>"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?" said I, advancing to the door of the tent.</p>

    <p>"Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?" he demanded.</p>

    <p>"I was thinking of shipping."</p>

    <p>"Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer&mdash;ever been in a stove boat?"</p>

    <p>"No, Sir, I never have."</p>

    <p>"Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say&mdash;eh?</p>

    <p>"Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I've been several voyages in the merchant service, and I
    think that&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?&mdash;I'll take that leg away from thy
    stern, if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel
    considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling,
    eh?&mdash;it looks a little suspicious, don't it, eh?&mdash;Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?&mdash;Didst not rob
    thy last Captain, didst thou?&mdash;Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?"</p>

    <p>I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes, this old
    seaman, as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all
    aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.</p>

    <p>"But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye."</p>

    <p>"Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world."</p>

    <p>"Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?"</p>

    <p>"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?"</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship."</p>

    <p>"I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself."</p>

    <p>"Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg&mdash;that's who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain
    Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part
    owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can
    put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young
    man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?"</p>

    <p>"Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest
    parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!&mdash;ah, ah!"</p>

    <p>I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding
    exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, "What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there
    was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact
    of the accident."</p>

    <p>"Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d'ye see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. SURE, ye've been
    to sea before now; sure of that?"</p>

    <p>"Sir," said I, "I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service&mdash;don't aggravate me&mdash;I won't have
    it. But let us understand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for
    it?"</p>

    <p>"I do, sir."</p>

    <p>"Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale's throat, and then jump after it? Answer,
    quick!"</p>

    <p>"I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don't take
    to be the fact."</p>

    <p>"Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye
    also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward
    there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there."</p>

    <p>For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether
    humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the
    errand.</p>

    <p>Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the
    flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly
    monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.</p>

    <p>"Well, what's the report?" said Peleg when I came back; "what did ye see?"</p>

    <p>"Not much," I replied&mdash;"nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and there's a squall coming up, I
    think."</p>

    <p>"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?
    Can't ye see the world where you stand?"</p>

    <p>I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any&mdash;I
    thought the best&mdash;and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness
    to ship me.</p>
