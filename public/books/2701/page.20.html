    <p>And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and
    conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian
    oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the
    English overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe
    are the Nantucketer's. For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of
    way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and
    privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the
    land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he
    alone resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro ploughing it
    as his own special plantation. THERE is his home; THERE lies his business, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt,
    though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides
    among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he
    comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the
    landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the
    Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds
    of walruses and whales.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 15. Chowder.</h2>
    <p>It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so
    we could attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had
    recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best
    kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his
    chowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the Try Pots. But
    the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church
    to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and
    that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us
    at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse&mdash;our first point of
    departure&mdash;must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the
    starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable
    inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.</p>

    <p>Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses' ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old
    top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that
    this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time,
    but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to
    the two remaining horns; yes, TWO of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It's ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my
    Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen's chapel; and here a
    gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?</p>

    <p>I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing
    in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on
    a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.</p>

    <p>"Get along with ye," said she to the man, "or I'll be combing ye!"</p>

    <p>"Come on, Queequeg," said I, "all right. There's Mrs. Hussey."</p>

    <p>And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to
    all his affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for
    the present, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded
    repast, turned round to us and said&mdash;"Clam or Cod?"</p>

    <p>"What's that about Cods, ma'am?" said I, with much politeness.</p>

    <p>"Clam or Cod?" she repeated.</p>

    <p>"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?" says I, "but that's a rather cold and
    clammy reception in the winter time, ain't it, Mrs. Hussey?"</p>

    <p>But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry,
    and seeming to hear nothing but the word "clam," Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen,
    and bawling out "clam for two," disappeared.</p>

    <p>"Queequeg," said I, "do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on one clam?"</p>

    <p>However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But
    when that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was
    made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up
    into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites
    being sharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him, and
    the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and
    bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping to the
    kitchen door, I uttered the word "cod" with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam
    came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.</p>

    <p>We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has
    any effect on the head? What's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? "But look, Queequeg, ain't that
    a live eel in your bowl? Where's your harpoon?"</p>
