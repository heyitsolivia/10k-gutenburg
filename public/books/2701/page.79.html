    <p>"'Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!'</p>

    <p>"'Look ye, now,' cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him, 'there are a few of us here (and I am one
    of them) who have shipped for the cruise, d'ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as soon as
    the anchor is down; so we don't want a row; it's not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work,
    but we won't be flogged.'</p>

    <p>"'Turn to!' roared the Captain.</p>

    <p>"Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:&mdash;'I tell you what it is now, Captain, rather than kill
    ye, and be hung for such a shabby rascal, we won't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till you say the
    word about not flogging us, we don't do a hand's turn.'</p>

    <p>"'Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I'll keep ye there till ye're sick of it. Down ye go.'</p>

    <p>"'Shall we?' cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against it; but at length, in obedience to
    Steelkilt, they preceded him down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.</p>

    <p>"As the Lakeman's bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and
    rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for the
    steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway.</p>

    <p>"Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down the crack, closed it, and turned the key
    upon them&mdash;ten in number&mdash;leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained neutral.</p>

    <p>"All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and aft, especially about the forecastle
    scuttle and fore hatchway; at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking through the
    bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at
    the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the
    ship.</p>

    <p>"At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell
    they refused. Water was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it; when
    again turning the key upon them and pocketing it, the Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for
    three days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the
    customary summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn
    to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had
    constrained them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest, but
    Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth
    morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain
    them. Only three were left.</p>

    <p>"'Better turn to, now?' said the Captain with a heartless jeer.</p>

    <p>"'Shut us up again, will ye!' cried Steelkilt.</p>

    <p>"'Oh certainly,' said the Captain, and the key clicked.</p>

    <p>"It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates, and stung by
    the mocking voice that had last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of
    despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to
    burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long,
    crescentic, heavy implements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any
    devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined
    him or not. That was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no opposition on the part
    of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a
    surrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time to make the rush
    should come. But to this their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly as his
    two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the
    ladder would but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come out.</p>

    <p>"Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would
    seem, upon the same piece of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be the first of the
    three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct
    might merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by
    some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a
    doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him
    with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.</p>

    <p>"Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and all his armed mates and harpooneers
    rushed for the forecastle. In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still struggling
    ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who
    had been fully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side
    by side, were seized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning.
    'Damn ye,' cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them, 'the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!'</p>

    <p>"At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the
    mutiny, he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round&mdash;thought, upon the whole, he would do
    so&mdash;he ought to&mdash;justice demanded it; but for the present, considering their timely surrender, he would
    let them go with a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.</p>

    <p>"'But as for you, ye carrion rogues,' turning to the three men in the rigging&mdash;'for you, I mean to mince ye
    up for the try-pots;' and, seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors, till
    they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.</p>
