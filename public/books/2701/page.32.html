    <p>"Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?" he roared. "Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy
    backbone! Why don't ye spring, I say, all of ye&mdash;spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red whiskers;
    spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!" And so
    saying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept
    leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.</p>

    <p>At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It was a short, cold Christmas; and as the
    short northern day merged into night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray
    cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like
    the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from the bows.</p>

    <p>Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the old craft deep dived into the green
    seas, and sent the shivering frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes were
    heard,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stand dressed in living green. So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While
    Jordan rolled between."</p>

    <p>Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They were full of hope and fruition. Spite of
    this frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was yet, it then
    seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by
    the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.</p>

    <p>At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no longer. The stout sail-boat that had
    accompanied us began ranging alongside.</p>

    <p>It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at this juncture, especially Captain
    Bildad. For loath to depart, yet; very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a
    voyage&mdash;beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested; a
    ship, in which an old shipmate sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to encounter all the
    terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to
    him,&mdash;poor old Bildad lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the cabin to speak
    another farewell word there; again came on deck, and looked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters,
    only bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right and left;
    looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout
    Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,
    "Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can."</p>

    <p>As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling
    in his eye, when the lantern came too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck&mdash;now a word
    below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.</p>

    <p>But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about him,&mdash;"Captain Bildad&mdash;come,
    old shipmate, we must go. Back the main-yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now! Careful,
    careful!&mdash;come, Bildad, boy&mdash;say your last. Luck to ye, Starbuck&mdash;luck to ye, Mr. Stubb&mdash;luck to
    ye, Mr. Flask&mdash;good-bye and good luck to ye all&mdash;and this day three years I'll have a hot supper smoking
    for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!"</p>

    <p>"God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men," murmured old Bildad, almost incoherently. "I hope ye'll
    have fine weather now, so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye&mdash;a pleasant sun is all he needs, and
    ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be careful in the hunt, ye mates. Don't stave the boats
    needlessly, ye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent. within the year. Don't forget your
    prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind that cooper don't waste the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in the green
    locker! Don't whale it too much a' Lord's days, men; but don't miss a fair chance either, that's rejecting Heaven's
    good gifts. Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I thought. If ye touch at the
    islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication. Good-bye, good-bye! Don't keep that cheese too long down in the hold, Mr.
    Starbuck; it'll spoil. Be careful with the butter&mdash;twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye, if&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,&mdash;away!" and with that, Peleg hurried him over the side, and
    both dropt into the boat.</p>

    <p>Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls
    wildly rolled; we gave three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.</h2>
    <p>Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the
    inn.</p>

    <p>When on that shivering winter's night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves, who
    should I see standing at her helm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man, who in
    mid-winter just landed from a four years' dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another
    tempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep
    memories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only say that it
    fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give
    succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that's
    kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship's direst jeopardy; she must fly all
    hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through. With all
    her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights 'gainst the very winds that fain would blow her
    homeward; seeks all the lashed sea's landlessness again; for refuge's sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only
    friend her bitterest foe!</p>
