    <p>Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia's Dismal Swamp, nor Rome's accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all
    the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean, which is the dark side
    of this earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than
    sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true&mdash;not true, or undeveloped. With books the same. The truest of all
    men was the Man of Sorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon's, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of
    woe. "All is vanity." ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomon's wisdom yet. But he who
    dodges hospitals and jails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than hell; calls
    Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais
    as passing wise, and therefore jolly;&mdash;not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb-stones, and break the green
    damp mould with unfathomably wondrous Solomon.</p>

    <p>But even Solomon, he says, "the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain" (I.E., even
    while living) "in the congregation of the dead." Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it invert thee, deaden
    thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a
    Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and
    become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the
    mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even
    though they soar.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 97. The Lamp.</h2>
    <p>Had you descended from the Pequod's try-works to the Pequod's forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping,
    for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings
    and counsellors. There they lay in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a score of
    lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.</p>

    <p>In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the
    dark, and stumble in darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he seeks the food of light,
    so he lives in light. He makes his berth an Aladdin's lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night
    the ship's black hull still houses an illumination.</p>

    <p>See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps&mdash;often but old bottles and vials,
    though&mdash;to the copper cooler at the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He burns,
    too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore, unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or
    astral contrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be
    sure of its freshness and genuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">CHAPTER 98. Stowing Down and Clearing Up.</h2>
    <p>Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the mast-head; how he is chased
    over the watery moors, and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside and beheaded; and
    how (on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his great
    padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like
    Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the fire;&mdash;but now it
    remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing&mdash;singing, if I may&mdash;the
    romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold, where once again
    leviathan returns to his native profundities, sliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to
    rise and blow.</p>

    <p>While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is
    pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over, end
    for end, and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last man-handled
    and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap, rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, EX
    OFFICIO, every sailor is a cooper.</p>

    <p>At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of
    the ship are thrown open, and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are replaced,
    and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.</p>

    <p>In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in all the business of whaling. One
    day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale's head
    are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted
    all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself;
    while on all hands the din is deafening.</p>

    <p>But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this self-same ship; and were it not for the
    tell-tale boats and try-works, you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a most
    scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the
    reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides, from the ashes of
    the burned scraps of the whale, a potent lye is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the
    whale remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and
    with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The soot is brushed from the lower rigging. All
    the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away. The great hatch is
    scrubbed and placed upon the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are
    coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship's company, the
    whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions;
    shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms
    new-leaped from out the daintiest Holland.</p>
