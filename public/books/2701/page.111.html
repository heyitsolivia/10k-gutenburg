    <p>As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into its eternal blue noon; and as not a
    single groan or cry of any sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths; what landsman
    would have thought, that beneath all that silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and
    wrenching in agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows. Seems it credible that by three
    such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and to
    what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said&mdash;"Canst thou fill
    his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold, the
    spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as
    stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!" This the creature? this he? Oh! that unfulfilments should follow
    the prophets. For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the mountains
    of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod's fish-spears!</p>

    <p>In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface, must have
    been long enough and broad enough to shade half Xerxes' army. Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must
    have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!</p>

    <p>"Stand by, men; he stirs," cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly
    conducting upwards to them, as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every oarsman felt
    them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a
    sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the
    sea.</p>

    <p>"Haul in! Haul in!" cried Starbuck again; "he's rising."</p>

    <p>The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth could have been gained, were now in long
    quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two ship's lengths of the
    hunters.</p>

    <p>His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals there are certain valves or flood-gates
    in many of their veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain
    directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the
    blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his
    whole arterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below
    the surface, his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in
    him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a
    considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and
    undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes,
    and the lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept
    continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its
    affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him had thus far
    been struck. His life, as they significantly call it, was untouched.</p>

    <p>As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his form, with much of it that is
    ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld. As
    strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the
    whale's eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see. But pity there was none. For
    all his old age, and his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the
    gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional
    inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured
    bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.</p>

    <p>"A nice spot," cried Flask; "just let me prick him there once."</p>

    <p>"Avast!" cried Starbuck, "there's no need of that!"</p>

    <p>But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and
    goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted
    at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat and
    marring the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly
    rolled away from the wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin, then over
    and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It
    was most piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some
    mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the
    ground&mdash;so the last long dying spout of the whale.</p>

    <p>Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its
    treasures unrifled. Immediately, by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so that ere
    long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. By very heedful
    management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the
    stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the
    bottom.</p>

    <p>It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was
    found imbedded in his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of harpoons are
    frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no
    prominence of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the
    present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a lance-head of
    stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone
    lance? And when? It might have been darted by some Nor' West Indian long before America was discovered.</p>
