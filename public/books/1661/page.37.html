      <p>&ldquo;A patient!&rdquo;  said she. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go out.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.</p>

      <p>We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open,
      and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You will excuse my calling so late,&rdquo;  she began, and then, suddenly losing her self-control, she
      ran forward, threw her arms about my wife&rsquo;s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m in such
      trouble!&rdquo;  she cried; &ldquo;I do so want a little help.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;  said my wife, pulling up her veil, &ldquo;it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I
      had not an idea who you were when you came in.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to do, so I came straight to you.&rdquo;  That was always the way. Folk who were
      in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and water, and sit here comfortably and
      tell us all about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no! I want the doctor&rsquo;s advice and help, too. It&rsquo;s about Isa. He has not been home
      for two days. I am so frightened about him!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband&rsquo;s trouble, to me as a doctor, to my
      wife as an old friend and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she
      know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?</p>

      <p>It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late he had, when the fit was on him, made use of
      an opium den in the farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, and he had
      come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and
      he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects. There
      he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How
      could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the
      ruffians who surrounded him?</p>

      <p>There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it. Might I not escort her to this place? And
      then, as a second thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney&rsquo;s medical adviser, and as such I
      had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him
      home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I
      had left my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand,
      as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to be.</p>

      <p>But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley
      lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge. Between a
      slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a
      cave, I found the den of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in
      the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I
      found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced
      with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship.</p>

      <p>Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders,
      bent knees, heads thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon
      the newcomer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the
      burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to
      themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes,
      and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words
      of his neighbour. At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a three-legged
      wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his
      knees, staring into the fire.</p>

      <p>As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me
      to an empty berth.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Thank you. I have not come to stay,&rdquo;  said I. &ldquo;There is a friend of mine here, Mr. Isa
      Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale,
      haggard, and unkempt, staring out at me.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;My God! It&rsquo;s Watson,&rdquo;  said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction, with every nerve in a
      twitter. &ldquo;I say, Watson, what o&rsquo;clock is it?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Nearly eleven.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Of what day?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Of Friday, June 19th.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d&rsquo;you want to frighten a chap
      for?&rdquo;  He sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be
      ashamed of yourself!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;So I am. But you&rsquo;ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few hours, three pipes, four
      pipes&#8212;I forget how many. But I&rsquo;ll go home with you. I wouldn&rsquo;t frighten Kate&#8212;poor little
      Kate. Give me your hand! Have you a cab?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have one waiting.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do
      nothing for myself.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile,
      stupefying fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier I
      felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice whispered, &ldquo;Walk past me, and then look back at me.&rdquo; 
      The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my
      side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down
      from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward and
      looked back. It took all my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment. He had turned
      his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had
      regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock
      Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round to the
      company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.</p>
