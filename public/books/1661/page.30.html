      <p>&ldquo;His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a
      fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his
      cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was
      enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway
      between our houses to talk it over.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree
      until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come
      uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she
      were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the
      power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of
      mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved
      if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I
      have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held
      me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and
      venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go
      back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that
      occurred.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, it is not for me to judge you,&rdquo;  said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had
      been drawn out. &ldquo;I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed
      at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to
      use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe
      with us.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Farewell, then,&rdquo;  said the old man solemnly. &ldquo;Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the
      easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine.&rdquo;  Tottering and shaking in all his giant
      frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;God help us!&rdquo;  said Holmes after a long silence. &ldquo;Why does fate play such tricks with poor,
      helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter&rsquo;s words, and say,
      &lsquo;There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>
        James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out
        by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he
        is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in
        ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.

      </p>

      <p>When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years &rsquo;82 and &rsquo;90,
      I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to
      choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not
      offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the
      object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,
      beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded
      rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is,
      however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am
      tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never
      have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.</p>

      <p>The year &rsquo;87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the
      records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber,
      of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the
      facts connected with the loss of the British barque <em>Sophy Anderson</em>, of the singular adventures of the Grice
      Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be
      remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man&rsquo;s watch, to prove that it had been wound up
      two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time&#8212;a deduction which was of
      the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them
      present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to
      describe.</p>

      <p>It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day
      the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great,
      hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the
      presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like
      untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like
      a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of
      crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell&rsquo;s fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale
      from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the
      sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother&rsquo;s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old
      quarters at Baker Street.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;  said I, glancing up at my companion, &ldquo;that was surely the bell. Who could come
      to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?&rdquo; </p>
