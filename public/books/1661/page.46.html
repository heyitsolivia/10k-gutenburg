      <p>&ldquo;Your reasoning is certainly plausible.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut,
      and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining. The
      lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all appear to be
      adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust
      of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time,
      while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could
      therefore, hardly be in the best of training.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But his wife&#8212;you said that she had ceased to love him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week&rsquo;s
      accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you
      also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife&rsquo;s affection.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But he might be a bachelor.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember the card upon the
      bird&rsquo;s leg.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his
      house?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that
      there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning
      tallow&#8212;walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other.
      Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, it is very ingenious,&rdquo;  said I, laughing; &ldquo;but since, as you said just now, there has
      been no crime committed, and no harm done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of
      energy.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open, and Peterson, the commissionaire,
      rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!&rdquo;  he gasped.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?&rdquo;  Holmes
      twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man&rsquo;s excited face.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!&rdquo;  He held out his hand and displayed upon the
      centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity
      and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand.</p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. &ldquo;By Jove, Peterson!&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;this is treasure trove
      indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than a precious stone. It is <em>the</em> precious stone.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not the Countess of Morcar&rsquo;s blue carbuncle!&rdquo;  I ejaculated.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in
      <em>The Times</em> every day lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the reward
      offered of <em>ï¿½</em>1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!&rdquo;  The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared
      from one to the other of us.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the
      background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the
      gem.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,&rdquo;  I remarked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused of having
      abstracted it from the lady&rsquo;s jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been
      referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here, I believe.&rdquo;  He rummaged amid his
      newspapers, glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the following
      paragraph:</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having
      upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue
      carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up
      to the dressing-room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the
      second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been
      called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the bureau had been forced open, and that
      the small morocco casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was
      lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but
      the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to the Countess,
      deposed to having heard Ryder&rsquo;s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the
      room, where she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as
      to the arrest of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest terms. Evidence
      of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal
      summarily with the offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion during
      the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Hum! So much for the police-court,&rdquo;  said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside the paper. &ldquo;The
      question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of
      a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much
      more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from
      Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So
      now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in
      this little mystery. To do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly in an
      advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.&rdquo; </p>
