      <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;  said Holmes, &ldquo;I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the
      Strand.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Third right, fourth left,&rdquo;  answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Smart fellow, that,&rdquo;  observed Holmes as we walked away. &ldquo;He is, in my judgment, the fourth
      smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something
      of him before.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Evidently,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of
      the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The knees of his trousers.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And what did you see?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What I expected to see.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why did you beat the pavement?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy&rsquo;s country.
      We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square
      presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries
      which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of
      commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of
      pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that
      they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo;  said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, &ldquo;I should like
      just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There
      is Mortimer&rsquo;s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank,
      the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane&rsquo;s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other
      block. And now, Doctor, we&rsquo;ve done our work, so it&rsquo;s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of
      coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed
      clients to vex us with their conundrums.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no
      ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his
      long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike
      those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was
      possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme
      exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative
      mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring
      energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in
      his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would
      suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those
      who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other
      mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James&rsquo;s Hall I felt that an evil
      time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,&rdquo;  he remarked as we emerged.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, it would be as well.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is
      serious.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why serious?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to
      stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;At what time?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ten will be early enough.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I shall be at Baker Street at ten.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your
      pocket.&rdquo;  He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.</p>

      <p>I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own
      stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen,
      and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen,
      while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I
      thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the <em>Encyclopaedia</em> down to the
      visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal
      expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes
      that this smooth-faced pawnbroker&rsquo;s assistant was a formidable man&#8212;a man who might play a deep game. I
      tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an
      explanation.</p>

      <p>It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford
      Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of
      voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I
      recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very
      shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ha! Our party is complete,&rdquo;  said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting
      crop from the rack. &ldquo;Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.
      Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night&rsquo;s adventure.&rdquo; </p>
