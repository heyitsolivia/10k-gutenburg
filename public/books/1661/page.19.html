      <p>&ldquo;And your father? Did you tell him?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer
      again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me?
      Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some
      reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what
      could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can&rsquo;t sleep
      a wink at night.&rdquo;  She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I shall glance into the case for you,&rdquo;  said Holmes, rising, &ldquo;and I have no doubt that we
      shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell
      upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your
      life.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll see him again?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I fear not.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then what has happened to him?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters
      of his which you can spare.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I advertised for him in last Saturday&rsquo;s <em>Chronicle</em>,&rdquo;  said she. &ldquo;Here is the slip
      and here are four letters from him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Thank you. And your address?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Mr. Angel&rsquo;s address you never had, I understand. Where is your father&rsquo;s place of
      business?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He travels for Westhouse &amp; Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the
      advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your
      life.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready
      when he comes back.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor
      which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise
      to come again whenever she might be summoned.</p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out
      in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily
      clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue
      cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Quite an interesting study, that maiden,&rdquo;  he observed. &ldquo;I found her more interesting than
      her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my
      index, in Andover in &rsquo;77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea,
      however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most
      instructive.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,&rdquo;  I remarked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was
      important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the
      great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman&rsquo;s appearance? Describe
      it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket
      was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather
      darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were
      worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn&rsquo;t observe. She had small round, hanging gold
      earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well
      indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a
      quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first
      glance is always at a woman&rsquo;s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser.
      As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The
      double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined.
      The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it
      farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face,
      and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and
      typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It surprised me.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that,
      though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a
      slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five,
      and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has
      come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a
      hurry.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And what else?&rdquo;  I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend&rsquo;s incisive
      reasoning.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You
      observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and
      finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been
      this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary,
      but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer
      Angel?&rdquo; </p>
