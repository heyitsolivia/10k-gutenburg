      <p>&ldquo;The game&rsquo;s up, Ryder,&rdquo;  said Holmes quietly. &ldquo;Hold up, man, or you&rsquo;ll be into the
      fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He&rsquo;s not got blood enough to go in for felony with
      impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be
      sure!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and
      he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could possibly need, so there is little
      which you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had heard,
      Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar&rsquo;s?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,&rdquo;  said he in a crackling voice.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I see&#8212;her ladyship&rsquo;s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired
      was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you
      used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man
      Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily
      upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady&rsquo;s room&#8212;you and your confederate
      Cusack&#8212;and you managed that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled the
      jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man arrested. You then&#8212;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion&rsquo;s knees. &ldquo;For
      God&rsquo;s sake, have mercy!&rdquo;  he shrieked. &ldquo;Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their
      hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I&rsquo;ll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don&rsquo;t
      bring it into court! For Christ&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Get back into your chair!&rdquo;  said Holmes sternly. &ldquo;It is very well to cringe and crawl now,
      but you thought little enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge against him will break
      down.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of the next act. How came the stone
      into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope of
      safety.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. &ldquo;I will tell you it just as it happened, sir,&rdquo;  said
      he. &ldquo;When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone
      at once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room.
      There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my
      sister&rsquo;s house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls
      for the market. All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; and, for all that
      it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what
      was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel.
      Then I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just been serving his time in
      Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of
      what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind
      to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone
      into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel.
      I might at any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning
      against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly an
      idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present,
      and I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my stone to
      Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds&#8212;a fine big one,
      white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my
      finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But
      the creature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the matter. As I turned to speak to
      her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?&rsquo; says she.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you said you&rsquo;d give me one for Christmas, and I was
      feeling which was the fattest.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ve set yours aside for you&#8212;Jem&rsquo;s bird, we
      call it. It&rsquo;s the big white one over yonder. There&rsquo;s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and
      one for us, and two dozen for the market.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you, Maggie,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;but if it is all the same to you, I&rsquo;d rather
      have that one I was handling just now.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The other is a good three pound heavier,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;and we fattened it
      expressly for you.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind. I&rsquo;ll have the other, and I&rsquo;ll take it now,&rsquo; said I.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, just as you like,&rsquo; said she, a little huffed. &lsquo;Which is it you want,
      then?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what
      I had done, for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, and we got
      a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some
      terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister&rsquo;s, and hurried into the back yard.
      There was not a bird to be seen there.</p>
