      <p>He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted
      London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a
      heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a
      coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous,
      hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with
      her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road,
      and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have seen those symptoms before,&rdquo;  said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire.
      &ldquo;Oscillation upon the pavement always means an <em>affaire de coeur</em>. She would like advice, but is not
      sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman
      has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we
      may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But
      here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while
      the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat.
      Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and
      bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to
      him.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Do you not find,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much
      typewriting?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I did at first,&rdquo;  she answered, &ldquo;but now I know where the letters are without looking.&rdquo; 
      Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and
      astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo;  she cried,
      &ldquo;else how could you know all that?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo;  said Holmes, laughing; &ldquo;it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have
      trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the
      police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I&rsquo;m not
      rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I
      would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?&rdquo;  asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips
      together and his eyes to the ceiling.</p>

      <p>Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. &ldquo;Yes, I did bang out
      of the house,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank&#8212;that
      is, my father&#8212;took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he
      would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and
      came right away to you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Your father,&rdquo;  said Holmes, &ldquo;your stepfather, surely, since the name is
      different.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two
      months older than myself.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And your mother is alive?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn&rsquo;t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so
      soon after father&rsquo;s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber
      in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the
      foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in
      wines. They got <em>�</em>4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn&rsquo;t near as much as father could have
      got if he had been alive.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the
      contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Your own little income,&rdquo;  he asked, &ldquo;does it come out of the business?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand
      stock, paying 4� per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the
      interest.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You interest me extremely,&rdquo;  said Holmes. &ldquo;And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a
      year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I
      believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about <em>�</em>60.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I
      don&rsquo;t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them.
      Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to
      mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I
      can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have made your position very clear to me,&rdquo;  said Holmes. &ldquo;This is my friend, Dr. Watson,
      before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer
      Angel.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>A flush stole over Miss Sutherland&rsquo;s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. &ldquo;I
      met him first at the gasfitters&rsquo; ball,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;They used to send father tickets when he was
      alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He
      never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But
      this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for
      us to know, when all father&rsquo;s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I
      had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he
      went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our
      foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.&rdquo; </p>
