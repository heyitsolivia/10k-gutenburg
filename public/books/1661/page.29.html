      <p>&ldquo;And the cigar-holder?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had been cut
      off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Holmes,&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you
      have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction
      in which all this points. The culprit is&#8212;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Mr. John Turner,&rdquo;  cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a
      visitor.</p>

      <p>The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the
      appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he
      was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding,
      drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen
      white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a
      glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pray sit down on the sofa,&rdquo;  said Holmes gently. &ldquo;You had my note?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid
      scandal.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And why did you wish to see me?&rdquo;  He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes,
      as though his question was already answered.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. &ldquo;It is so. I know all about
      McCarthy.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The old man sank his face in his hands. &ldquo;God help me!&rdquo;  he cried. &ldquo;But I would not have let
      the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the
      Assizes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you say so,&rdquo;  said Holmes gravely.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart&#8212;it will break
      her heart when she hears that I am arrested.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It may not come to that,&rdquo;  said Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am
      acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am a dying man,&rdquo;  said old Turner. &ldquo;I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a
      question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. &ldquo;Just
      tell us the truth,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can
      witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that
      I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as well,&rdquo;  said the old man; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a question whether I shall live to the
      Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing
      clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you
      out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life.
      I&rsquo;ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It was in the early &rsquo;60&rsquo;s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and
      reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim,
      took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and
      we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the
      diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the
      Ballarat Gang.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it.
      There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first
      volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the
      wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him,
      though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the
      gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old
      pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in
      the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I
      married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her
      wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf
      and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back
      or a boot to his foot.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here we are, Jack,&rsquo; says he, touching me on the arm; &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll be as good as
      a family to you. There&rsquo;s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you
      don&rsquo;t&#8212;it&rsquo;s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there&rsquo;s always a policeman within
      hail.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent
      free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there
      was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of
      her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without
      question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.</p>
