      <p>&ldquo;No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock
      but as an intellectual problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company
      with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson&rsquo;s fire. The
      facts are these: about four o&rsquo;clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest
      fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In
      front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose
      slung over his shoulder. As he reached the corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a
      little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man&rsquo;s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend
      himself and, swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect
      the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking
      person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the labyrinth of
      small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of
      Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape
      of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Which surely he restored to their owner?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that &lsquo;For Mrs. Henry Baker&rsquo; was printed
      upon a small card which was tied to the bird&rsquo;s left leg, and it is also true that the initials &lsquo;H.
      B.&rsquo; are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of
      Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What, then, did Peterson do?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even the smallest problems
      are of interest to me. The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite of the
      slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off,
      therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman
      who lost his Christmas dinner.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Did he not advertise?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Only as much as we can deduce.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;From his hat?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man
      who has worn this article?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of
      the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal
      discoloured. There was no maker&rsquo;s name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials &ldquo;H. B.&rdquo;  were
      scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest,
      it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt
      to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I can see nothing,&rdquo;  said I, handing it back to my friend.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are
      too timid in drawing your inferences.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him.
      &ldquo;It is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been,&rdquo;  he remarked, &ldquo;and yet there are a few
      inferences which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability.
      That the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly
      well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less
      now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to
      indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that
      his wife has ceased to love him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My dear Holmes!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,&rdquo;  he continued, disregarding my
      remonstrance. &ldquo;He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is
      middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with
      lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by the way, that it is
      extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You are certainly joking, Holmes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how
      they are attained?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example,
      how did you deduce that this man was intellectual?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of
      his nose. &ldquo;It is a question of cubic capacity,&rdquo;  said he; &ldquo;a man with so large a brain must have
      something in it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The decline of his fortunes, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came in then. It is a hat of the very
      best quality. Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy so
      expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the
      world.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and the moral
      retrogression?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes laughed. &ldquo;Here is the foresight,&rdquo;  said he putting his finger upon the little disc
      and loop of the hat-securer. &ldquo;They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a
      certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we
      see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight
      now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavoured to
      conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost
      his self-respect.&rdquo; </p>
