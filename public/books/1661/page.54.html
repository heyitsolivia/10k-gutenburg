      <p>&ldquo;He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott&rsquo;s conduct had long been notorious in the
      county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been
      fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which
      were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the
      flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large
      staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no
      marks of any violence upon her.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;How about poison?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The doctors examined her for it, but without success.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I
      cannot imagine.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, there are nearly always some there.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band&#8212;a speckled band?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have
      referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the
      spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which
      she used.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;These are very deep waters,&rdquo;  said he; &ldquo;pray go on with your narrative.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago,
      however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His
      name is Armitage&#8212;Percy Armitage&#8212;the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My
      stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days
      ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I
      have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept.
      Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly
      heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit
      the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and
      as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to
      Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your
      advice.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have done wisely,&rdquo;  said my friend. &ldquo;But have you told me all?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, all.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor&rsquo;s
      knee. Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have been cruelly used,&rdquo;  said Holmes.</p>

      <p>The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. &ldquo;He is a hard man,&rdquo;  she said,
      &ldquo;and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling
      fire.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;This is a very deep business,&rdquo;  he said at last. &ldquo;There are a thousand details which I should
      desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to
      Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your
      stepfather?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable
      that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she
      is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;By no means.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the
      twelve o&rsquo;clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to.
      Will you not wait and breakfast?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look
      forward to seeing you again this afternoon.&rdquo;  She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from
      the room.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And what do you think of it all, Watson?&rdquo;  asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Dark enough and sinister enough.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window,
      and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious
      end.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying
      woman?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I cannot think.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate
      terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in
      preventing his stepdaughter&rsquo;s marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen
      Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters
      falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along
      those lines.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But what, then, did the gipsies do?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I see many objections to any such theory.&rdquo; </p>
