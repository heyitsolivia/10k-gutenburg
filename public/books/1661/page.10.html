      <p>&ldquo;The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just
      this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why that?&rsquo; I asks.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed
      Men. It&rsquo;s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more
      vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits&rsquo; end what to do with the money. If my
      hair would only change colour, here&rsquo;s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, what is it, then?&rsquo; I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man,
      and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot
      over the door-mat. In that way I didn&rsquo;t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a
      bit of news.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?&rsquo; he asked with his eyes
      open.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what are they worth?&rsquo; I asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere
      very much with one&rsquo;s other occupations.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good
      for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell me all about it,&rsquo; said I.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, showing me the advertisement, &lsquo;you can see for yourself that
      the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make
      out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was
      himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had
      left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of
      easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to
      do.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;there would be millions of red-headed men who would
      apply.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not so many as you might think,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;You see it is really confined to
      Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old
      town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or
      anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but
      perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred
      pounds.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich
      tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as
      any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove
      useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very
      willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the
      advertisement.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man
      who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked
      with red-headed folk, and Pope&rsquo;s Court looked like a coster&rsquo;s orange barrow. I should not have thought
      there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of
      colour they were&#8212;straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were
      not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in
      despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and
      butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double
      stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could
      and soon found ourselves in the office.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Your experience has been a most entertaining one,&rdquo;  remarked Holmes as his client paused and
      refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. &ldquo;Pray continue your very interesting statement.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small
      man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he
      always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a
      very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any
      of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,&rsquo; said my assistant, &lsquo;and he is willing to fill a
      vacancy in the League.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And he is admirably suited for it,&rsquo; the other answered. &lsquo;He has every
      requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.&rsquo; He took a step backward, cocked his head on
      one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and
      congratulated me warmly on my success.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It would be injustice to hesitate,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;You will, however, I am sure,
      excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.&rsquo; With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until
      I yelled with the pain. &lsquo;There is water in your eyes,&rsquo; said he as he released me. &lsquo;I perceive
      that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint.
      I could tell you tales of cobbler&rsquo;s wax which would disgust you with human nature.&rsquo; He stepped over to
      the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment
      came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be
      seen except my own and that of the manager.</p>
