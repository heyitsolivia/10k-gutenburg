      <p>&ldquo;What can it mean?&rdquo;  I gasped.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It means that it is all over,&rdquo;  Holmes answered. &ldquo;And perhaps, after all, it is for the best.
      Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott&rsquo;s room.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door
      without any reply from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my
      hand.</p>

      <p>It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open,
      throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this table, on the
      wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and
      his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we
      had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the
      corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be
      bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The band! the speckled band!&rdquo;  whispered Holmes.</p>

      <p>I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his
      hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is a swamp adder!&rdquo;  cried Holmes; &ldquo;the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten
      seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit
      which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to
      some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man&rsquo;s lap, and throwing the noose round the
      reptile&rsquo;s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm&rsquo;s length, threw it into the
      iron safe, which he closed upon it.</p>

      <p>Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should
      prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the
      terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow
      process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a
      dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back
      next day.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I had,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how
      dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word
      &lsquo;band,&rsquo; which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a
      hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only
      claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever
      danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was
      speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the
      bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the
      suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The
      idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished
      with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of
      poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever
      and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would
      also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the
      two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the
      whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it,
      probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this
      ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the
      bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later
      she must fall a victim.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me
      that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach
      the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel
      any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather
      hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps
      which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did
      also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;With the result of driving it through the ventilator.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my
        cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no
        doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott&rsquo;s death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh
        very heavily upon my conscience.&rdquo;

      </p>

      <p>Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years
      of our intimacy, there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice&#8212;that of Mr.
      Hatherley&rsquo;s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton&rsquo;s madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a
      finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in
      its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings
      for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story has, I believe,
      been told more than once in the newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when
      set forth <em>en bloc</em> in a single half-column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes,
      and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth.
      At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to
      weaken the effect.</p>
