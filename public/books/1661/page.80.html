      <p>I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing
      for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no
      surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was
      with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim as possible.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;but you remember that our
      client has rather an early appointment this morning.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why, it is after nine now,&rdquo;  I answered. &ldquo;I should not be surprised if that were he. I
      thought I heard a ring.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change which had come over him, for his face
      which was naturally of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at
      least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of
      the morning before, and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;Only two days ago I was a
      happy and prosperous man, without a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. One sorrow
      comes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Deserted you?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall
      table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all might have
      been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this
      note:</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;MY DEAREST UNCLE:&#8212;I feel that I have brought trouble upon you, and that if I had
      acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever
      again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that
      is provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me.
      In life or in death, I am ever your loving</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;MARY.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are
      nearing the end of your troubles.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned something! Where are the
      gems?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You would not think <em>�</em>1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I would pay ten.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And there is a little reward, I fancy.
      Have you your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for <em>�</em>4000.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little
      triangular piece of gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.</p>

      <p>With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have it!&rdquo;  he gasped. &ldquo;I am saved! I am saved!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he hugged his recovered gems to his
      bosom.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,&rdquo;  said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Owe!&rdquo;  He caught up a pen. &ldquo;Name the sum, and I will pay it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried
      himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then it was not Arthur who took them?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is
      known.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him, and finding that he would
      not tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few
      details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And let me say to you, first, that
      which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell
      and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My Mary? Impossible!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew the true character
      of this man when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in England&#8212;a
      ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of
      such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she
      alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the
      habit of seeing him nearly every evening.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I cannot, and I will not, believe it!&rdquo;  cried the banker with an ashen face.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought,
      gone to your room, slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane. His
      footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked
      lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are
      women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had
      hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and
      told you about one of the servants&rsquo; escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was all perfectly
      true.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his
      uneasiness about his club debts. In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose and,
      looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into
      your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to
      see what would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the light of the
      passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he,
      thrilling with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in
      the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then
      closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.</p>
