      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where are they all, Maggie?&rsquo; I cried.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gone to the dealer&rsquo;s, Jem.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Which dealer&rsquo;s?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But was there another with a barred tail?&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;the same as the one I
      chose?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell them apart.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man
      Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You
      heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.
      Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now&#8212;and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched
      the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me! God help me!&rdquo;  He burst into convulsive sobbing, with
      his face buried in his hands.</p>

      <p>There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock
      Holmes&rsquo; finger-tips upon the edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo;  said he.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No more words. Get out!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp
      rattle of running footfalls from the street.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;After all, Watson,&rdquo;  said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, &ldquo;I am not retained
        by the police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow
        will not appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just
        possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him
        to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in
        our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you will have the goodness
        to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief
        feature.&rdquo;

        <h2 class="chapter-break"><a name="8">VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND</a></h2>
      </p>

      <p>On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the
      methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none
      commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused
      to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic. Of all
      these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was
      associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The events in question occurred in
      the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is
      possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from
      which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given.
      It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are
      widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than
      the truth.</p>

      <p>It was early in April in the year &rsquo;83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully
      dressed, by the side of my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that
      it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for
      I was myself regular in my habits.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s the common lot this morning.
      Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What is it, then&#8212;a fire?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists
      upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this
      hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing
      which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it
      from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid
      deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the
      problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my
      friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window,
      rose as we entered.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Good-morning, madam,&rdquo;  said Holmes cheerily. &ldquo;My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate
      friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that
      Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot
      coffee, for I observe that you are shivering.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is not cold which makes me shiver,&rdquo;  said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as
      requested.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.&rdquo;  She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she
      was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like
      those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with
      premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,
      all-comprehensive glances.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You must not fear,&rdquo;  said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm. &ldquo;We shall
      soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.&rdquo; </p>
