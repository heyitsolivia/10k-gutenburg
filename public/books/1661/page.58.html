      <p>&ldquo;I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My dear Holmes!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott&rsquo;s
      cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could
      only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner&rsquo;s inquiry. I deduced a
      ventilator.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But what harm can there be in that?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady
      who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I cannot as yet see any connection.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I cannot say that I have.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and
      to the rope&#8212;or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Holmes,&rdquo;  I cried, &ldquo;I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to
      prevent some subtle and horrible crime.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has
      nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even
      deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before
      the night is over; for goodness&rsquo; sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to
      something more cheerful.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>About nine o&rsquo;clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the
      Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light
      shone out right in front of us.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is our signal,&rdquo;  said Holmes, springing to his feet; &ldquo;it comes from the middle
      window.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to
      an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were out on the
      dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to
      guide us on our sombre errand.</p>

      <p>There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making
      our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from
      a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the
      grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo;  I whispered; &ldquo;did you see it?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he
      broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is a nice household,&rdquo;  he murmured. &ldquo;That is the baboon.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it
      upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes&rsquo;
      example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the
      shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had seen it in the
      daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it
      was all that I could do to distinguish the words:</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The least sound would be fatal to our plans.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I nodded to show that I had heard.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I nodded again.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I
      will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.</p>

      <p>Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of
      matches and the stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.</p>

      <p>How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and
      yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which
      I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.</p>

      <p>From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine,
      which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock,
      which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two
      and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.</p>

      <p>Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished
      immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room had lit
      a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew
      stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible&#8212;a very
      gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we
      heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You see it, Watson?&rdquo;  he yelled. &ldquo;You see it?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden
      glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so
      savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had ceased
      to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most
      horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and
      anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant
      parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at
      Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.</p>
