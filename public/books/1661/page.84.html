      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Your duty
      would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided
      always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should be happy to make myself useful.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you know&#8212;faddy but
      kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you, you would not object to our little
      whim. Heh?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, considerably astonished at his words.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, no.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a
      rather peculiar tint of chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in this
      offhand fashion.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am afraid that that is quite impossible,&rsquo; said I. He had been watching me eagerly
      out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am afraid that it is quite essential,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;It is a little fancy of my
      wife&rsquo;s, and ladies&rsquo; fancies, you know, madam, ladies&rsquo; fancies must be consulted. And so you
      won&rsquo;t cut your hair?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, sir, I really could not,&rsquo; I answered firmly.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity, because in other respects
      you would really have done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young
      ladies.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us, but she
      glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a
      handsome commission through my refusal.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?&rsquo; she asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you please, Miss Stoper.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most excellent offers in this
      fashion,&rsquo; said she sharply. &lsquo;You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening
      for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.&rsquo; She struck a gong upon the table, and I was shown out by the
      page.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard, and two or
      three bills upon the table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all, if these
      people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay
      for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting <em>�</em>100 a year. Besides, what use was my
      hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was
      inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride
      so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from
      the gentleman himself. I have it here and I will read it to you:</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;DEAR MISS HUNTER:&#8212;Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, and I write from
      here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she
      has been much attracted by my description of you. We are willing to give <em>�</em>30 a quarter, or <em>�</em>120 a
      year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very
      exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a
      dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging
      to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to
      sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As
      regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short
      interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may
      recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come,
      and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully,</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;JEPHRO RUCASTLE.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind is made up that I will accept it.
      I thought, however, that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your
      consideration.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the question,&rdquo;  said Holmes, smiling.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;But you would not advise me to refuse?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply
      for.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind,
      good-natured man. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear
      she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an
      outbreak?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is a possible solution&#8212;in fact, as matters stand, it is the most probable one. But in any
      case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, yes, of course the pay is good&#8212;too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give
      you <em>�</em>120 a year, when they could have their pick for <em>�</em>40? There must be some strong reason
      behind.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I
      should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me.&rdquo; </p>
