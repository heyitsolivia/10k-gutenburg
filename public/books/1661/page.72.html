      <p>Just before nine o&rsquo;clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room. His features were gravely set,
      but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;They have laid the supper, then,&rdquo;  he said, rubbing his hands.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;I am surprised that Lord St.
      Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than
      ever, and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;My messenger reached you, then?&rdquo;  asked Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have you good authority for what you
      say?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The best possible.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What will the Duke say,&rdquo;  he murmured, &ldquo;when he hears that one of the family has been
      subjected to such humiliation?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise, though
      her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at
      such a crisis.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It was a slight, sir, a public slight,&rdquo;  said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon the
      table.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been shamefully used.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I think that I heard a ring,&rdquo;  said Holmes. &ldquo;Yes, there are steps on the landing. If I cannot
      persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more
      successful.&rdquo;  He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman. &ldquo;Lord St. Simon,&rdquo;  said he
      &ldquo;allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already
      met.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast
      down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady had taken a
      quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for
      his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re angry, Robert,&rdquo;  said she. &ldquo;Well, I guess you have every cause to
      be.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pray make no apology to me,&rdquo;  said Lord St. Simon bitterly.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went; but
      I was kind of rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing or
      saying. I only wonder I didn&rsquo;t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this
      matter?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;If I may give an opinion,&rdquo;  remarked the strange gentleman, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had just a little
      too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights
      of it.&rdquo;  He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell our story right away,&rdquo;  said the lady. &ldquo;Frank here and I met in
      &rsquo;84, in McQuire&rsquo;s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other,
      Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that
      petered out and came to nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn&rsquo;t hear of our
      engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to &rsquo;Frisco. Frank wouldn&rsquo;t throw up his hand,
      though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him
      mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and make his pile, too, and
      never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and
      pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we be married right away,
      then,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and then I will feel sure of you; and I won&rsquo;t claim to be your husband until I
      come back?&rsquo; Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in
      waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then
      I heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners&rsquo; camp had been
      attacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank&rsquo;s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was
      very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in &rsquo;Frisco. Not a
      word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon
      came to &rsquo;Frisco, and we came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt all
      the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor
      Frank.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I&rsquo;d have done my duty by him. We can&rsquo;t
      command our love, but we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good
      a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I glanced
      back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when
      I looked again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or
      sorry to see him. I wonder I didn&rsquo;t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the words of the
      clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Should I stop the service
      and make a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know what I was thinking, for he raised
      his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was
      writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note
      into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me
      to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just
      whatever he might direct.</p>
