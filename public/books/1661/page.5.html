      <p>&ldquo;I am following you closely,&rdquo;  I answered.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman
      sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached&#8212;evidently the man of whom I had
      heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the
      door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the
      sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he
      emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his
      pocket and looked at it earnestly, &lsquo;Drive like the devil,&rsquo; he shouted, &lsquo;first to Gross &amp;
      Hankey&rsquo;s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you
      do it in twenty minutes!&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane
      came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the
      tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn&rsquo;t pulled up before she shot out of the hall
      door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man
      might die for.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Church of St. Monica, John,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;and half a sovereign if you reach
      it in twenty minutes.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I
      should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare,
      but I jumped in before he could object. &lsquo;The Church of St. Monica,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and half a
      sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.&rsquo; It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was
      clear enough what was in the wind.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;My cabby drove fast. I don&rsquo;t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The
      cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried
      into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed
      to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side
      aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced
      round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank God,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll do. Come! Come!&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What then?&rsquo; I asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won&rsquo;t be legal.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses
      which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the
      secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there
      was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in
      front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it
      that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the
      clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the
      bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I
      mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,&rdquo;  said I; &ldquo;and what then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate
      departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they
      separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. &lsquo;I shall drive out in the park at five
      as usual,&rsquo; she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went
      off to make my own arrangements.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Which are?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Some cold beef and a glass of beer,&rdquo;  he answered, ringing the bell. &ldquo;I have been too busy to
      think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your
      co-operation.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind breaking the law?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Nor running a chance of arrest?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not in a good cause.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, the cause is excellent!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then I am your man.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was sure that I might rely on you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But what is it you wish?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now,&rdquo;  he said as he turned
      hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, &ldquo;I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not
      much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather,
      returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And what then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I
      must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am to be neutral?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end
      in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to
      station yourself close to that open window.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And when I raise my hand&#8212;so&#8212;you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will,
      at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Entirely.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is nothing very formidable,&rdquo;  he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket.
      &ldquo;It is an ordinary plumber&rsquo;s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.
      Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people.
      You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself
      clear?&rdquo; </p>
