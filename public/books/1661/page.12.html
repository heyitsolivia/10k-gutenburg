      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;the gentleman at No. 4.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What, the red-headed man?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my
      room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where could I find him?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St.
      Paul&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps,
      and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And what did you do then?&rdquo;  asked Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in
      any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes.
      I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give
      advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And you did very wisely,&rdquo;  said Holmes. &ldquo;Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I
      shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang
      from it than might at first sight appear.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Grave enough!&rdquo;  said Mr. Jabez Wilson. &ldquo;Why, I have lost four pound a week.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;As far as you are personally concerned,&rdquo;  remarked Holmes, &ldquo;I do not see that you have any
      grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some <em>ï¿½</em>30,
      to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You
      have lost nothing by them.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this
      prank&#8212;if it was a prank&#8212;upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and
      thirty pounds.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This
      assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement&#8212;how long had he been with
      you?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;About a month then.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;How did he come?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;In answer to an advertisement.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Was he the only applicant?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, I had a dozen.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why did you pick him?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Because he was handy and would come cheap.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;At half wages, in fact.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he&rsquo;s not short of thirty.
      Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. &ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;Have
      you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo;  said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. &ldquo;He is still with you?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And has your business been attended to in your absence?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Nothing to complain of, sir. There&rsquo;s never very much to do of a morning.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a
      day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, Watson,&rdquo;  said Holmes when our visitor had left us, &ldquo;what do you make of it
      all?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I make nothing of it,&rdquo;  I answered frankly. &ldquo;It is a most mysterious business.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;As a rule,&rdquo;  said Holmes, &ldquo;the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be.
      It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most
      difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, then?&rdquo;  I asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;To smoke,&rdquo;  he answered. &ldquo;It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won&rsquo;t
      speak to me for fifty minutes.&rdquo;  He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his
      hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some
      strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he
      suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the
      mantelpiece.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Sarasate plays at the St. James&rsquo;s Hall this afternoon,&rdquo;  he remarked. &ldquo;What do you
      think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way.
      I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than
      Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene
      of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where
      four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy
      grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere.
      Three gilt balls and a brown board with &ldquo;JABEZ WILSON&rdquo;  in white letters, upon a corner house,
      announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it
      with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he
      walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he
      returned to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three
      times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow,
      who asked him to step in.</p>
