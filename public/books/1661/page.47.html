      <p>&ldquo;What will you say?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: &lsquo;Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose
      and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker
      Street.&rsquo; That is clear and concise.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very. But will he see it?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one. He was
      clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of
      nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird.
      Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his
      attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening
      papers.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;In which, sir?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, in the <em>Globe</em>, <em>Star</em>, <em>Pall Mall</em>, <em>St. James&rsquo;s</em>, <em>Evening News</em>,
      <em>Standard</em>, <em>Echo</em>, and any others that occur to you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very well, sir. And this stone?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and
      leave it here with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now
      devouring.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
      bonny thing,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of
      crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil&rsquo;s pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may
      stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in
      southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade
      instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a
      vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of
      crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison?
      I&rsquo;ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I cannot tell.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do with the
      matter?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that
      the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I
      shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And you can do nothing until then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in the evening at the hour
      you have mentioned, for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By the way, in view of recent
      occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once
      more. As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin
      waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived the door was
      opened, and we were shown up together to Holmes&rsquo; room.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,&rdquo;  said he, rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the
      easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume. &ldquo;Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is
      a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have
      just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a
      pointed beard of grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand,
      recalled Holmes&rsquo; surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with
      the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in
      a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and
      letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;We have retained these things for some days,&rdquo;  said Holmes, &ldquo;because we expected to see an
      advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. &ldquo;Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once
      were,&rdquo;  he remarked. &ldquo;I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my
      hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;To eat it!&rdquo;  Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon
      the sideboard, which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally
      well?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly, certainly,&rdquo;  answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of relief.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, so if you
      wish&#8212;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The man burst into a hearty laugh. &ldquo;They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure,&rdquo;  said he,
      &ldquo;but beyond that I can hardly see what use the <em>disjecta membra</em> of my late acquaintance are going to
      be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I
      perceive upon the sideboard.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There is your hat, then, and there your bird,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;By the way, would it bore you to
      tell me where you got the other one from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown
      goose.&rdquo; </p>
