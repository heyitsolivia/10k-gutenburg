      <p>&ldquo;As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman
      whom he loved. But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, and
      how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened the window,
      sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George
      Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one
      side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son struck Sir George and cut him over
      the eye. Then something suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his hands, rushed back,
      closed the window, ascended to your room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle
      and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo;  gasped the banker.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your
      warmest thanks. He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little
      enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her
      secret.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,&rdquo;  cried Mr. Holder. &ldquo;Oh,
      my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow
      wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged
      him!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;When I arrived at the house,&rdquo;  continued Holmes, &ldquo;I at once went very carefully round it to
      observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening
      before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen&rsquo;s
      path, but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the far side of the
      kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a
      wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was
      shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. I
      thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had already spoken to me, and
      inquiry showed it was so. I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, which I took
      to be the police; but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in
      front of me.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double line which I saw with delight
      belonged to a man with naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son.
      The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over the
      depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up and found they led
      to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which
      was a hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where the snow was cut up as though
      there had been a struggle, and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not
      mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been
      hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared, so there was an
      end to that clue.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill and framework of the hall window
      with my lens, and I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of an instep
      where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had
      occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your
      son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength
      causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the prize, but had left a fragment
      in the grasp of his opponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who was it brought him
      the coronet?</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however
      improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained
      your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their
      place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why
      he should retain her secret&#8212;the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had
      seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a
      certainty.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh the love and
      gratitude which she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends was a very
      limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation
      among women. It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that
      Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word
      without compromising his own family.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir
      George&rsquo;s house, managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his head
      the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off
      shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,&rdquo;  said Mr. Holder.</p>
