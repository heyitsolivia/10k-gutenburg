      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My name,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners
      upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I answered that I had not.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;His face fell immediately.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; he said gravely, &lsquo;that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you
      say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their
      maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but
      after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the case of another,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the objection might be fatal, but we must
      stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your
      new duties?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,&rsquo; said I.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!&rsquo; said Vincent Spaulding. &lsquo;I should be
      able to look after that for you.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What would be the hours?&rsquo; I asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ten to two.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Now a pawnbroker&rsquo;s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and
      Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.
      Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That would suit me very well,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;And the pay?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is <em>ï¿½</em>4 a week.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And the work?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is purely nominal.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you call purely nominal?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you
      leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don&rsquo;t comply
      with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,&rsquo; said I.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No excuse will avail,&rsquo; said Mr. Duncan Ross; &lsquo;neither sickness nor business nor
      anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And the work?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is to copy out the <em>Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>. There is the first volume of it in that
      press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be
      ready to-morrow?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; I answered.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important
      position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.&rsquo; He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my
      assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite
      persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could
      not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a
      sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the <em>Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>. Vincent Spaulding did what he
      could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I
      determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets
      of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope&rsquo;s Court.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for
      me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then
      he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o&rsquo;clock he bade
      me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden
      sovereigns for my week&rsquo;s work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was
      there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a
      morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for
      an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that
      I would not risk the loss of it.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and
      Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B&rsquo;s before very long. It cost
      me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole
      business came to an end.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;To an end?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o&rsquo;clock, but the door
      was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it
      is, and you can read for yourself.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:THE
      RED-HEADED LEAGUEISDISSOLVED.October 9, 1890.</p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of
      the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I cannot see that there is anything very funny,&rdquo;  cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his
      flaming head. &ldquo;If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo;  cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. &ldquo;I
      really wouldn&rsquo;t miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will
      excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card
      upon the door?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them
      seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground
      floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never
      heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.</p>
