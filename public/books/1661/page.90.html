      <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone for the dog!&rdquo;  cried Miss Hunter.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have my revolver,&rdquo;  said I.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Better close the front door,&rdquo;  cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the stairs together. We had
      hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying
      sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at
      a side door.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo;  he cried. &ldquo;Someone has loosed the dog. It&rsquo;s not been fed for two days. Quick,
      quick, or it&rsquo;ll be too late!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge
      famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle&rsquo;s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground.
      Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases
      of his neck. With much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We
      laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did
      what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman
      entered the room.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Toller!&rdquo;  cried Miss Hunter.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity
      you didn&rsquo;t let me know what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains were
      wasted.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;  said Holmes, looking keenly at her. &ldquo;It is clear that Mrs. Toller knows more about this
      matter than anyone else.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am
      still in the dark.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I will soon make it clear to you,&rdquo;  said she; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d have done so before now if I
      could ha&rsquo; got out from the cellar. If there&rsquo;s police-court business over this, you&rsquo;ll remember
      that I was the one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice&rsquo;s friend too.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn&rsquo;t, from the time that her father married again. She
      was slighted like and had no say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr.
      Fowler at a friend&rsquo;s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was
      so quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr.
      Rucastle&rsquo;s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward, who
      would ask for all that the law would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her
      to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her money. When she wouldn&rsquo;t do it, he
      kept on worrying her until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death&rsquo;s door. Then she got better
      at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but that didn&rsquo;t make no change in her
      young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said Holmes, &ldquo;I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter
      fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of
      imprisonment?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr.
      Fowler.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That was it, sir.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be, blockaded the house, and having met
      you succeeded by certain arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the same as
      his.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,&rdquo;  said Mrs. Toller serenely.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink, and that a ladder should be
      ready at the moment when your master had gone out.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have it, sir, just as it happened.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,&rdquo;  said Holmes, &ldquo;for you have certainly cleared
      up everything which puzzled us. And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we
      had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our <em>locus standi</em> now is rather a
      questionable one.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>
        And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle
        survived, but was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife. They still live
        with their old servants, who probably know so much of Rucastle&rsquo;s past life that he finds it difficult to
        part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in Southampton the day after
        their flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet
        Hunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further interest in her when once she had
        ceased to be the centre of one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall, where I
        believe that she has met with considerable success.
