      <p>&ldquo;Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances. Again I
      changed my dress, again I sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my
      employer had an immense <em>rï¿½pertoire</em>, and which he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel,
      and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud
      to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a
      sentence, he ordered me to cease and to change my dress.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary
      performance could possibly be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the window, so
      that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be
      impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I
      concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my
      handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I confess
      that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance, however,
      I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed
      to be looking in my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there. This man,
      however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my
      handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said
      nothing, but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me.
      She rose at once.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jephro,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who
      stares up at Miss Hunter.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I know no one in these parts.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Surely it would be better to take no notice.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round and wave him away like
      that.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down the blind. That was a week ago, and
      from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the
      road.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pray continue,&rdquo;  said Holmes. &ldquo;Your narrative promises to be a most interesting
      one.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to be little relation between the
      different incidents of which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me
      to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain,
      and the sound as of a large animal moving about.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look in here!&rsquo; said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two planks. &lsquo;Is he
      not a beauty?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague figure huddled up in the
      darkness.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rsquo; said my employer, laughing at the start which I had
      given. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man
      who can do anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as keen as
      mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For
      goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it&rsquo;s
      as much as your life is worth.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two
      o&rsquo;clock in the morning. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was silvered
      over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that
      something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was.
      It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones.
      It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side. That dreadful sentinel sent a
      chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and
      I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to
      amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest
      of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with
      my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.
      It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to
      open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but
      I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the
      impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With
      trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two
      tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could
      make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter
      to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the
      whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced
      that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day,
      however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a
      look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His
      cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He
      locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.</p>
