      <p>&ldquo;Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money. I do not mean that any beggar in
      the streets of London could earn <em>�</em>700 a year&#8212;which is less than my average takings&#8212;but I had
      exceptional advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by practice
      and made me quite a recognised character in the City. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in
      upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take <em>�</em>2.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country, and eventually married, without
      anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the City. She little
      knew what.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out
      of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed
      full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the
      Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she
      could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig.
      Even a wife&rsquo;s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a
      search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a
      small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted
      by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it
      out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment
      there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief,
      that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as
      long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I
      slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a
      hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That note only reached her yesterday,&rdquo;  said Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Good God! What a week she must have spent!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The police have watched this Lascar,&rdquo;  said Inspector Bradstreet, &ldquo;and I can quite understand
      that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his,
      who forgot all about it for some days.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That was it,&rdquo;  said Holmes, nodding approvingly; &ldquo;I have no doubt of it. But have you never
      been prosecuted for begging?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Many times; but what was a fine to me?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It must stop here, however,&rdquo;  said Bradstreet. &ldquo;If the police are to hush this thing up,
      there must be no more of Hugh Boone.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again,
      then all must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter
      up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I reached this one,&rdquo;  said my friend, &ldquo;by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of
        shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast.&rdquo;

        <h2 class="chapter-break"><a name="7">VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE</a></h2>
      </p>

      <p>Ihad called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas, with the intention of
      wishing him the compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack
      within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand.
      Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard-felt
      hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
      suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You are engaged,&rdquo;  said I; &ldquo;perhaps I interrupt you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results. The matter is a perfectly
      trivial one&rdquo; &#8212;he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat&#8212;&ldquo;but there are points in
      connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in,
      and the windows were thick with the ice crystals. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo;  I remarked, &ldquo;that, homely as it
      looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it&#8212;that it is the clue which will guide you in the
      solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, no. No crime,&rdquo;  said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. &ldquo;Only one of those whimsical little
      incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a
      few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of
      events may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and
      bizarre without being criminal. We have already had experience of such.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;So much so,&rdquo;  I remarked, &ldquo;that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes, three
      have been entirely free of any legal crime.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary
      Sutherland, and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small matter
      will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson, the commissionaire?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is to him that this trophy belongs.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is his hat.&rdquo; </p>
