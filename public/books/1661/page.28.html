      <p>&ldquo;It has been a case of considerable interest,&rdquo;  he remarked, returning to his natural manner.
      &ldquo;I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with
      Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the
      cab, and I shall be with you presently.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him
      the stone which he had picked up in the wood.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;This may interest you, Lestrade,&rdquo;  he remarked, holding it out. &ldquo;The murder was done with
      it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I see no marks.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;There are none.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;How do you know, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence
      it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And the murderer?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak,
      smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other
      indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Lestrade laughed. &ldquo;I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;Theories are all very
      well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;<em>Nous verrons</em>,&rdquo;  answered Holmes calmly. &ldquo;You work your own method, and I shall work
      mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And leave your case unfinished?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, finished.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But the mystery?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is solved.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Who was the criminal, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The gentleman I describe.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But who is he?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I am a practical man,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;and I really cannot
      undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the
      laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo;  said Holmes quietly. &ldquo;I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings.
      Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was
      silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing
      position.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Look here, Watson,&rdquo;  he said when the cloth was cleared &ldquo;just sit down in this chair and let
      me preach to you for a little. I don&rsquo;t know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar
      and let me expound.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pray do so.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy&rsquo;s narrative which
      struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his
      father should, according to his account, cry &lsquo;Cooee!&rsquo; before seeing him. The other was his singular
      dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son&rsquo;s
      ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad
      says is absolutely true.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What of this &lsquo;Cooee!&rsquo; then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It
      was mere chance that he was within earshot. The &lsquo;Cooee!&rsquo; was meant to attract the attention of whoever
      it was that he had the appointment with. But &lsquo;Cooee&rsquo; is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is
      used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at
      Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What of the rat, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. &ldquo;This is a map of
      the Colony of Victoria,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;I wired to Bristol for it last night.&rdquo;  He put his hand over
      part of the map. &ldquo;What do you read?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;ARAT,&rdquo;  I read.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo;  He raised his hand.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;BALLARAT.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He
      was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is wonderful!&rdquo;  I exclaimed.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey
      garment was a third point which, granting the son&rsquo;s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come
      now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the
      estate, where strangers could hardly wander.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which
      I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But how did you gain them?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be
      told from their traces.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, they were peculiar boots.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But his lameness?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it.
      Why? Because he limped&#8212;he was lame.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But his left-handedness.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow
      was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a
      left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even smoked
      there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an
      Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of
      140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and
      discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are
      rolled in Rotterdam.&rdquo; </p>
