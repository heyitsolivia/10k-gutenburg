      <p>&ldquo;Then I do not see the point.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks
      as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how
      quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they
      would have arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that
      those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel
      which brought the writer.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is possible.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case, and why I urged
      young Openshaw to caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to
      travel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo;  I cried. &ldquo;What can it mean, this relentless persecution?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the
      sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not have
      carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner&rsquo;s jury. There must have been several in it, and
      they must have been men of resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who
      it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a
      society.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But of what society?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Have you never&#8212;&rdquo;  said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his
      voice&#8212;&ldquo;have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I never have.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo;  said he presently:</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking
      a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the
      Civil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,
      Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for the
      terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its
      views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally
      recognised shape&#8212;a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving
      this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the matter
      out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the
      organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any man
      succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For
      some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better
      classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed,
      although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You will observe,&rdquo;  said Holmes, laying down the volume, &ldquo;that the sudden breaking up of the
      society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been
      cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their
      track. You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South, and that
      there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then the page we have seen&#8212;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, &lsquo;sent the pips to A, B, and
      C&rsquo;&#8212;that is, sent the society&rsquo;s warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A and B
      cleared, or left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I
      think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw
      has in the meantime is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so
      hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more
      miserable ways of our fellow men.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which
      hangs over the great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You will excuse me for not waiting for you,&rdquo;  said he; &ldquo;I have, I foresee, a very busy day
      before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw&rsquo;s.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What steps will you take?&rdquo;  I asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may have to go down to Horsham, after
      all.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You will not go there first?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your
      coffee.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a
      heading which sent a chill to my heart.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Holmes,&rdquo;  I cried, &ldquo;you are too late.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said he, laying down his cup, &ldquo;I feared as much. How was it done?&rdquo;  He spoke
      calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading &lsquo;Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.&rsquo; Here is
      the account:</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near
      Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and
      stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The
      alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. It proved to be
      that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket, was John
      Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the
      last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked
      over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces of violence,
      and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the
      effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside
      landing-stages.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
