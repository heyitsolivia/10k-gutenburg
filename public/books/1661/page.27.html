      <p>There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o&rsquo;clock
      Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There is serious news this morning,&rdquo;  Lestrade observed. &ldquo;It is said that Mr. Turner, of the
      Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;An elderly man, I presume?&rdquo;  said Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing
      health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy&rsquo;s,
      and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent
      free.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Indeed! That is interesting,&rdquo;  said Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to
      him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little
      of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to
      Turner&rsquo;s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if
      it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner
      himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;We have got to the deductions and the inferences,&rdquo;  said Lestrade, winking at me. &ldquo;I find it
      hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo;  said Holmes demurely; &ldquo;you do find it very hard to tackle the
      facts.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,&rdquo;  replied
      Lestrade with some warmth.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And that is&#8212;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the
      merest moonshine.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,&rdquo;  said Holmes, laughing. &ldquo;But I am very much
      mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, that is it.&rdquo;  It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed,
      with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,
      gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when
      the maid, at Holmes&rsquo; request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a
      pair of the son&rsquo;s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from
      seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the
      winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.</p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet
      thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows
      were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face
      was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,
      sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely
      concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most,
      only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran
      through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that
      district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on
      either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the
      meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend
      with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite
      end.</p>

      <p>The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the
      boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it
      upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner&rsquo;s
      dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass
      twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact
      spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces
      which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes,
      very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a
      scent, and then turned upon my companion.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What did you go into the pool for?&rdquo;  he asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on
      earth&#8212;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A
      mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here
      before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper
      came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of
      the same feet.&rdquo;  He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the
      time rather to himself than to us. &ldquo;These are young McCarthy&rsquo;s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he
      ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran
      when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father&rsquo;s feet as he paced up and down. What is this,
      then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes!
      tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again&#8212;of course that was for the
      cloak. Now where did they come from?&rdquo;  He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track
      until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the
      neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a
      little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering
      up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark
      of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined
      and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were
      lost.</p>
