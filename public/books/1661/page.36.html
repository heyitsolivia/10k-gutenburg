      <p>We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;That hurts my pride, Watson,&rdquo;  he said at last. &ldquo;It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it
      hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon
      this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him away to his death&#8212;!&rdquo;  He
      sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks
      and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;They must be cunning devils,&rdquo;  he exclaimed at last. &ldquo;How could they have decoyed him down
      there? The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on
      such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out
      now!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;To the police?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take the flies, but not
      before.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker
      Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock before he entered, looking pale and
      worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down
      with a long draught of water.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You are hungry,&rdquo;  I remarked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since breakfast.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And how have you succeeded?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have a clue?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let
      us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these
      he took five and thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote &ldquo;S. H. for J. O.&rdquo; 
      Then he sealed it and addressed it to &ldquo;Captain James Calhoun, Barque <em>Lone Star</em>, Savannah,
      Georgia.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That will await him when he enters port,&rdquo;  said he, chuckling. &ldquo;It may give him a sleepless
      night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And who is this Captain Calhoun?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;How did you trace it, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates and names.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have spent the whole day,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;over Lloyd&rsquo;s registers and files of the old
      papers, following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in
      &rsquo;83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months. Of these,
      one, the <em>Lone Star</em>, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared
      from London, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the Union.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Texas, I think.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an American origin.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque <em>Lone Star</em> was there in January,
      &rsquo;85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of
      London.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The <em>Lone Star</em> had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had
      been taken down the river by the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend and
      learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the
      Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What will you do, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the
      ship. The others are Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last night. I
      had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah
      the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these
      three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>
        There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to
        receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon
        their track. Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the
        <em>Lone Star</em> of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the
        Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters &ldquo;L.
        S.&rdquo;  carved upon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the <em>Lone Star</em>.

      </p>

      <p>Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the Theological College of St.
      George&rsquo;s, was much addicted to opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when
      he was at college; for having read De Quincey&rsquo;s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched
      his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the
      practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an
      object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow, pasty face,
      drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.</p>

      <p>One night&#8212;it was in June, &rsquo;89&#8212;there came a ring to my bell, about the hour when a man gives
      his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap
      and made a little face of disappointment.</p>
