      <p>&ldquo;Then how many are there?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;How many? I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there
      are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little
      problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested
      in this.&rdquo;  He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table.
      &ldquo;It came by the last post,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;Read it aloud.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The note was undated, and without either signature or address.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo;  it said, &ldquo;a
      gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the
      royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an
      importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your
      chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;This is indeed a mystery,&rdquo;  I remarked. &ldquo;What do you imagine that it means?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to
      twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from
      it?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,&rdquo;  I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my
      companion&rsquo;s processes. &ldquo;Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly
      strong and stiff.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Peculiar&#8212;that is the very word,&rdquo;  said Holmes. &ldquo;It is not an English paper at all. Hold
      it up to the light.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I did so, and saw a large &ldquo;E&rdquo;  with a small &ldquo;g,&rdquo;  a &ldquo;P,&rdquo;  and a large
      &ldquo;G&rdquo;  with a small &ldquo;t&rdquo;  woven into the texture of the paper.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What do you make of that?&rdquo;  asked Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not at all. The &lsquo;G&rsquo; with the small &lsquo;t&rsquo; stands for &lsquo;Gesellschaft,&rsquo;
      which is the German for &lsquo;Company.&rsquo; It is a customary contraction like our &lsquo;Co.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;P,&rsquo; of course, stands for &lsquo;Papier.&rsquo; Now for the &lsquo;Eg.&rsquo; Let us glance at our
      Continental Gazetteer.&rdquo;  He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. &ldquo;Eglow,
      Eglonitz&#8212;here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country&#8212;in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.
      &lsquo;Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and
      paper-mills.&rsquo; Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?&rdquo;  His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great
      blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The paper was made in Bohemia,&rdquo;  I said.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the
      sentence&#8212;&lsquo;This account of you we have from all quarters received.&rsquo; A Frenchman or Russian could
      not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to
      discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his
      face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses&rsquo; hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a
      sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;A pair, by the sound,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he continued, glancing out of the window.
      &ldquo;A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There&rsquo;s money in
      this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I think that I had better go, Holmes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be
      interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But your client&#8212;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor,
      and give us your best attention.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the
      door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;  said Holmes.</p>

      <p>A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a
      Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy
      bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue
      cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch
      which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at
      the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole
      appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending
      down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was
      still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,
      with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of
      obstinacy.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You had my note?&rdquo;  he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. &ldquo;I
      told you that I would call.&rdquo;  He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pray take a seat,&rdquo;  said Holmes. &ldquo;This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is
      occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your
      friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not,
      I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.&rdquo; </p>
