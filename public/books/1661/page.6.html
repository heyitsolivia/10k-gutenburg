      <p>&ldquo;I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object,
      then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then you may entirely rely on me.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to
      play.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded
      Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and
      general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not
      merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh
      part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a
      specialist in crime.</p>

      <p>It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found
      ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down
      in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it
      from Sherlock Holmes&rsquo; succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On
      the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of
      shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were
      flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their
      mouths.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo;  remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, &ldquo;this marriage
      rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as
      averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now
      the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Where, indeed?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy
      concealment about a woman&rsquo;s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched.
      Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with
      her.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Where, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women
      are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She
      could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to
      bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where
      she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But it has twice been burgled.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pshaw! They did not know how to look.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But how will you look?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I will not look.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I will get her to show me.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But she will refuse.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to
      the letter.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little
      landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed
      forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed
      up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides
      with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck,
      and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and
      struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to
      protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running
      freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the
      other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in
      to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the
      steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into
      the street.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Is the poor gentleman much hurt?&rdquo;  she asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo;  cried several voices.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, no, there&rsquo;s life in him!&rdquo;  shouted another. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll be gone before you can
      get him to hospital.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a brave fellow,&rdquo;  said a woman. &ldquo;They would have had the lady&rsquo;s purse and
      watch if it hadn&rsquo;t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he&rsquo;s breathing
      now.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed
      the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I
      could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for
      the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw
      the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the
      injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had
      intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are
      not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.</p>

      <p>Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across
      and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into
      the room with a cry of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;  The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of
      spectators, well dressed and ill&#8212;gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids&#8212;joined in a general shriek of
      &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;  Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse
      of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.
      Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to
      find my friend&rsquo;s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for
      some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.</p>
