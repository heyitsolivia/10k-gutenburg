      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You blackguard!&rsquo; I shouted, beside myself with rage. &lsquo;You have destroyed it!
      You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the jewels which you have stolen?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stolen!&rsquo; he cried.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, thief!&rsquo; I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,&rsquo; said he.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a
      thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have called me names enough,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I will not stand it any longer. I
      shall not say another word about this business, since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the
      morning and make my own way in the world.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You shall leave it in the hands of the police!&rsquo; I cried half-mad with grief and rage.
      &lsquo;I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You shall learn nothing from me,&rsquo; said he with a passion such as I should not have
      thought was in his nature. &lsquo;If you choose to call the police, let the police find what they can.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was the first to
      rush into my room, and, at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur&rsquo;s face, she read the whole story and, with
      a scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the investigation into
      their hands at once. When the inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with his
      arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a
      private matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that
      the law should have its way in everything.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At least,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you will not have me arrested at once. It would be to your
      advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen,&rsquo; said I.
      And then, realising the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my
      honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which
      would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing
      stones.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You may as well face the matter,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;you have been caught in the act, and
      no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling
      us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,&rsquo; he answered, turning away from me
      with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it.
      I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only of his person but of his
      room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could
      be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats. This morning he was
      removed to a cell, and I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to you to implore you
      to use your skill in unravelling the matter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make
      nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I have already offered a reward of
      <em>ï¿½</em>1000. My God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I
      do!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro, droning to himself like a child whose
      grief has got beyond words.</p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Do you receive much company?&rdquo;  he asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur&rsquo;s. Sir George Burnwell has
      been several times lately. No one else, I think.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Do you go out much in society?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is unusual in a young girl.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-and-twenty.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her also.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Terrible! She is even more affected than I.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have neither of you any doubt as to your son&rsquo;s guilt?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, it was twisted.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten it?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he
      doing there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both
      ways. There are several singular points about the case. What did the police think of the noise which awoke you
      from your sleep?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;They considered that it might be caused by Arthur&rsquo;s closing his bedroom door.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they
      say, then, of the disappearance of these gems?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Have they thought of looking outside the house?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has already been minutely
      examined.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Now, my dear sir,&rdquo;  said Holmes, &ldquo;is it not obvious to you now that this matter really
      strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a
      simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your
      son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet,
      broke off by main force a small portion of it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the
      thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six into the room
      in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory
      tenable?&rdquo; </p>
