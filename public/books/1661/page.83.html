      <p>&ldquo;DEAR MR. HOLMES:&#8212;I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a
      situation which has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not
      inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,</p>

      <p>&ldquo;VIOLET HUNTER.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Do you know the young lady?&rdquo;  I asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not I.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is half-past ten now.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember that the affair of the blue
      carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this
      case, also.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is
      the person in question.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a
      bright, quick face, freckled like a plover&rsquo;s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own
      way to make in the world.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,&rdquo;  said she, as my companion rose to greet her,
      &ldquo;but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I
      could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client. He looked her over
      in his searching fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips together, to
      listen to her story.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have been a governess for five years,&rdquo;  said she, &ldquo;in the family of Colonel Spence Munro,
      but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to
      America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but
      without success. At last the little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my wit&rsquo;s end as
      to what I should do.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway&rsquo;s, and there I used
      to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was the
      name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office,
      and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by one, when she consults
      her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper
      was not alone. A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold
      upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the
      ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That will do,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I could not ask for anything better. Capital!
      capital!&rsquo; He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such
      a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are looking for a situation, miss?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As governess?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what salary do you ask?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I had <em>�</em>4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, tut, tut! sweating&#8212;rank sweating!&rsquo; he cried, throwing his fat hands out
      into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. &lsquo;How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with
      such attractions and accomplishments?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;A little
      French, a little German, music, and drawing&#8212;&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tut, tut!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;This is all quite beside the question. The point is, have
      you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not
      fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country. But if
      you have why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures? Your
      salary with me, madam, would commence at <em>�</em>100 a year.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be
      true. The gentleman, however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and took
      out a note.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is also my custom,&rsquo; said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes
      were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, &lsquo;to advance to my young ladies half
      their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their
      wardrobe.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to
      my tradesmen, the advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the whole
      transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May I ask where you live, sir?&rsquo; said I.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the far side of
      Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One child&#8212;one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing
      cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!&rsquo; He leaned back in his
      chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was a little startled at the nature of the child&rsquo;s amusement, but the father&rsquo;s laughter
      made me think that perhaps he was joking.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My sole duties, then,&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;are to take charge of a single
      child?&rsquo;</p>
