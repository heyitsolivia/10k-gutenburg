      <p>Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My friend rose now and paced up and down the
      room, his hands in his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Is Toller still drunk?&rdquo;  he asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing with him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, the wine-cellar.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter.
      Do you think that you could perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite
      exceptional woman.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I will try. What is it?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o&rsquo;clock, my friend and I. The Rucastles will be gone by
      that time, and Toller will, we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If
      you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate matters
      immensely.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I will do it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course there is only one feasible
      explanation. You have been brought there to personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.
      That is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I
      remember right, who was said to have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height,
      figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very possibly in some illness through which she has
      passed, and so, of course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came upon her tresses. The man
      in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers&#8212;possibly her <em>fiancï¿½</em>&#8212;and no doubt, as you wore
      the girl&rsquo;s dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he saw you, and
      afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his
      attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is
      fairly clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What on earth has that to do with it?&rdquo;  I ejaculated.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by
      the study of the parents. Don&rsquo;t you see that the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my
      first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children. This child&rsquo;s disposition is
      abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty&rsquo;s sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I
      should suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,&rdquo;  cried our client. &ldquo;A thousand things come back to
      me which make me certain that you have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor
      creature.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We can do nothing until seven
      o&rsquo;clock. At that hour we shall be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap
      at a wayside public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of
      the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the
      door-step.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Have you managed it?&rdquo;  asked Holmes.</p>

      <p>A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. &ldquo;That is Mrs. Toller in the cellar,&rdquo;  said
      she. &ldquo;Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.
      Rucastle&rsquo;s.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have done well indeed!&rdquo;  cried Holmes with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Now lead the way, and we shall
      soon see the end of this black business.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage, and found ourselves in front of the
      barricade which Miss Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he tried the
      various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence Holmes&rsquo; face
      clouded over.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I trust that we are not too late,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;I think, Miss Hunter, that we had better go in
      without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength. Together we rushed into the room. It
      was empty. There was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. The skylight
      above was open, and the prisoner gone.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There has been some villainy here,&rdquo;  said Holmes; &ldquo;this beauty has guessed Miss
      Hunter&rsquo;s intentions and has carried his victim off.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.&rdquo;  He swung himself up onto the roof.
      &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo;  he cried, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how
      he did it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But it is impossible,&rdquo;  said Miss Hunter; &ldquo;the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went
      away.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man. I should not be very
      much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be as well for
      you to have your pistol ready.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room, a very fat and burly man,
      with a heavy stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock
      Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You villain!&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s your daughter?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is for me to ask you that,&rdquo;  he shrieked, &ldquo;you thieves! Spies and thieves! I have caught
      you, have I? You are in my power. I&rsquo;ll serve you!&rdquo;  He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as
      he could go.</p>
