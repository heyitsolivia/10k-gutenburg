      <p>It was in the summer of &rsquo;89, not long after my marriage, that the events occurred which I am now about to
      summarise. I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I
      continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and
      visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington
      Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering
      disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he
      might have any influence.</p>

      <p>One morning, at a little before seven o&rsquo;clock, I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce
      that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by
      experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, the
      guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him here,&rdquo;  he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s all
      right.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo;  I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he
      had caged up in my room.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new patient,&rdquo;  he whispered. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d bring him round myself; then
      he couldn&rsquo;t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the
      same as you.&rdquo;  And off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.</p>

      <p>I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of
      heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his hands he had a
      handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I
      should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was
      suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;but I have had a very serious
      accident during the night. I came in by train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might
      find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left
      it upon the side-table.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I took it up and glanced at it. &ldquo;Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd
      floor).&rdquo;  That was the name, style, and abode of my morning visitor. &ldquo;I regret that I have kept you
      waiting,&rdquo;  said I, sitting down in my library-chair. &ldquo;You are fresh from a night journey, I understand,
      which is in itself a monotonous occupation.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,&rdquo;  said he, and laughed. He laughed very heartily, with
      a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against
      that laugh.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo;  I cried; &ldquo;pull yourself together!&rdquo;  and I poured out some water from a
      caraffe.</p>

      <p>It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when
      some great crisis is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have been making a fool of myself,&rdquo;  he gasped.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not at all. Drink this.&rdquo;  I dashed some brandy into the water, and the colour began to come back to
      his bloodless cheeks.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better!&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;And now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my
      thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it.
      There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have been. It had been
      hacked or torn right out from the roots.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo;  I cried, &ldquo;this is a terrible injury. It must have bled
      considerably.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time.
      When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the
      wrist and braced it up with a twig.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own province.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;This has been done,&rdquo;  said I, examining the wound, &ldquo;by a very heavy and sharp
      instrument.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;A thing like a cleaver,&rdquo;  said he.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;An accident, I presume?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;By no means.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What! a murderous attack?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very murderous indeed.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You horrify me.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised
      bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;  I asked when I had finished.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was very weak, but I have had a good
      deal to go through.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but, between ourselves, if it were not for
      the convincing evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a
      very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and, even if they
      believe me, the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be
      done.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;  cried I, &ldquo;if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved,
      I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official
      police.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, I have heard of that fellow,&rdquo;  answered my visitor, &ldquo;and I should be very glad if he
      would take the matter up, though of course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me an
      introduction to him?&rdquo; </p>
