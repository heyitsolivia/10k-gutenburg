      <p>&ldquo;Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started
      that he had two important commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks.
      Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure,
      to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the
      offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office of
      the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St.
      Clair had her lunch, started for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company&rsquo;s office, got her
      packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you
      followed me so far?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is very clear.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in
      the hope of seeing a cab, as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. While she was walking
      in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband
      looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. The window was open,
      and she distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to
      her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some
      irresistible force from behind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore
      some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the steps&#8212;for the house was none
      other than the opium den in which you found me to-night&#8212;and running through the front room she attempted to
      ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel
      of whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into
      the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune,
      met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The inspector and
      two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to
      the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that
      floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there.
      Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon. So
      determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair
      had been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from
      it. Out there fell a cascade of children&rsquo;s bricks. It was the toy which he had promised to bring home.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed, made the inspector realise that the
      matter was serious. The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. The front
      room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one
      of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is
      covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one and opened
      from below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and several scattered drops were
      visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes
      of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch&#8212;all
      were there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other traces of Mr.
      Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the
      ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for the tide was at
      its very highest at the moment of the tragedy.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known
      to be a man of the vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair&rsquo;s story, he was known to have been at the
      foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband&rsquo;s appearance at the window, he could hardly have
      been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had
      no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he could not account in any way for the presence
      of the missing gentleman&rsquo;s clothes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the
      opium den, and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh
      Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a professional
      beggar, though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little
      distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in
      the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his
      lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon
      the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional
      acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you
      see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face
      disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog
      chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all
      mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply
      to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been
      the lodger at the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in
      quest.&rdquo; </p>
