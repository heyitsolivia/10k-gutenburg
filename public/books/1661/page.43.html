      <p>&ldquo;He is asleep,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;You can see him very well.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing
      slowly and heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a coloured shirt
      protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the
      grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right
      across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth
      were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a beauty, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;  said the inspector.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;He certainly needs a wash,&rdquo;  remarked Holmes. &ldquo;I had an idea that he might, and I took the
      liberty of bringing the tools with me.&rdquo;  He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my
      astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;He! he! You are a funny one,&rdquo;  chuckled the inspector.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a
      much more respectable figure.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know why not,&rdquo;  said the inspector. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look a credit to
      the Bow Street cells, does he?&rdquo;  He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell.
      The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug,
      moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner&rsquo;s face.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Let me introduce you,&rdquo;  he shouted, &ldquo;to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee, in the county of
      Kent.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man&rsquo;s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from
      a tree. Gone was the coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and the twisted
      lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there,
      sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his
      eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream
      and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo;  cried the inspector, &ldquo;it is, indeed, the missing man. I know him from the
      photograph.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny. &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; 
      said he. &ldquo;And pray what am I charged with?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;With making away with Mr. Neville St.&#8212; Oh, come, you can&rsquo;t be charged with that unless they
      make a case of attempted suicide of it,&rdquo;  said the inspector with a grin. &ldquo;Well, I have been
      twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, and that, therefore,
      I am illegally detained.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No crime, but a very great error has been committed,&rdquo;  said Holmes. &ldquo;You would have done
      better to have trusted your wife.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It was not the wife; it was the children,&rdquo;  groaned the prisoner. &ldquo;God help me, I would not
      have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;of course you can
      hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case
      against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers.
      Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the
      proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo;  cried the prisoner passionately. &ldquo;I would have endured imprisonment, ay,
      even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I
      received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a reporter on an
      evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and
      I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying
      begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an actor I had, of course,
      learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill. I took advantage now of
      my attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one
      side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of hair, and
      an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really
      as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that
      I had received no less than 26<em>s</em>. 4<em>d</em>.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a
      friend and had a writ served upon me for <em>�</em>25. I was at my wit&rsquo;s end where to get the money, but a
      sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight&rsquo;s grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my
      employers, and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In ten days I had the money and had paid
      the debt.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at <em>�</em>2 a week when I knew
      that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and
      sitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up
      reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and
      filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to
      lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself
      into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that
      my secret was safe in his possession.</p>
