      <p>&ldquo;You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No
      servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time
      of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Your sister is dead, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand
      that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We
      had, however, an aunt, my mother&rsquo;s maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were
      occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady&rsquo;s house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago,
      and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement
      when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been
      fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he
      half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pray be precise as to details,&rdquo;  said he.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The
      manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing
      are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the
      first is Dr. Roylott&rsquo;s, the second my sister&rsquo;s, and the third my own. There is no communication
      between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Perfectly so.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room
      early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong
      Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat
      for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o&rsquo;clock she rose to leave me, but she
      paused at the door and looked back.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell me, Helen,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of
      the night?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; said I.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Certainly not. But why?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low,
      clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from&#8212;perhaps from
      the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it
      also.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.&rsquo; She smiled back at me, closed my
      door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;  said Holmes. &ldquo;Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Always.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of
      security unless our doors were locked.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you
      will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely
      allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the
      windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew
      that it was my sister&rsquo;s voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor.
      As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a
      clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister&rsquo;s door was unlocked,
      and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it.
      By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands
      groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms
      round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is
      in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but
      as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, &lsquo;Oh, my God! Helen! It
      was the band! The speckled band!&rsquo; There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed
      with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor&rsquo;s room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and
      choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his
      dressing-gown. When he reached my sister&rsquo;s side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her
      throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without
      having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo;  said Holmes, &ldquo;are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you
      swear to it?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it,
      and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been
      deceived.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Was your sister dressed?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her
      left a match-box.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important.
      And what conclusions did the coroner come to?&rdquo; </p>
