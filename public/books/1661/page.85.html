      <p>&ldquo;Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be the
      most interesting which has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of the
      features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger&#8212;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Danger! What danger do you foresee?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes shook his head gravely. &ldquo;It would cease to be a danger if we could define it,&rdquo;  said he.
      &ldquo;But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is enough.&rdquo;  She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face.
      &ldquo;I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my
      poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.&rdquo;  With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us
      both good-night and bustled off upon her way.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo;  said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the stairs, &ldquo;she seems to be
      a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And she would need to be,&rdquo;  said Holmes gravely. &ldquo;I am much mistaken if we do not hear from
      her before many days are past.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>It was not very long before my friend&rsquo;s prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during which I
      frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human experience
      this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to
      something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was
      quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, with
      knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it.
      &ldquo;Data! data! data!&rdquo;  he cried impatiently. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make bricks without clay.&rdquo;  And
      yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation.</p>

      <p>The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes
      was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would
      leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to
      breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to
      me.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,&rdquo;  said he, and turned back to his chemical studies.</p>

      <p>The summons was a brief and urgent one.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,&rdquo;  it said. &ldquo;Do come! I
      am at my wit&rsquo;s end.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;HUNTER.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Will you come with me?&rdquo;  asked Holmes, glancing up.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I should wish to.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Just look it up, then.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;There is a train at half-past nine,&rdquo;  said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. &ldquo;It is due at
      Winchester at 11:30.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones, as we may need
      to be at our best in the morning.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>By eleven o&rsquo;clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital. Holmes had been
      buried in the morning papers all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and
      began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds
      drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the
      air, which set an edge to a man&rsquo;s energy. All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around
      Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new
      foliage.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Are they not fresh and beautiful?&rdquo;  I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of
      Baker Street.</p>

      <p>But Holmes shook his head gravely.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Do you know, Watson,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine
      that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and
      you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their
      isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo;  I cried. &ldquo;Who would associate crime with these dear old
      homesteads?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the
      lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and
      beautiful countryside.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You horrify me!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot
      accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard&rsquo;s blow,
      does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so
      close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look
      at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little
      of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in
      such places, and none the wiser. Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I should
      never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she
      is not personally threatened.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Quite so. She has her freedom.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What <em>can</em> be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them.
      But which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting
      for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to
      tell.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance from the station, and there we found the
      young lady waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.</p>
