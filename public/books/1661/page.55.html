      <p>&ldquo;And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see
      whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and
      that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of
      the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop
      swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth
      seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the
      sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot
      eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Which of you is Holmes?&rdquo;  asked this apparition.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,&rdquo;  said my companion quietly.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Indeed, Doctor,&rdquo;  said Holmes blandly. &ldquo;Pray take a seat.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been
      saying to you?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is a little cold for the time of the year,&rdquo;  said Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What has she been saying to you?&rdquo;  screamed the old man furiously.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,&rdquo;  continued my companion imperturbably.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ha! You put me off, do you?&rdquo;  said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his
      hunting-crop. &ldquo;I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the
      meddler.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>My friend smiled.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Holmes, the busybody!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>His smile broadened.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes chuckled heartily. &ldquo;Your conversation is most entertaining,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;When you go out
      close the door, for there is a decided draught.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I will go when I have said my say. Don&rsquo;t you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss
      Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.&rdquo;  He stepped swiftly
      forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;See that you keep yourself out of my grip,&rdquo;  he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the
      fireplace he strode out of the room.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;He seems a very amiable person,&rdquo;  said Holmes, laughing. &ldquo;I am not quite so bulky, but if he
      had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.&rdquo;  As he spoke he
      picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives
      zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in
      allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to
      Doctors&rsquo; Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>It was nearly one o&rsquo;clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet
      of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have seen the will of the deceased wife,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;To determine its exact meaning I have
      been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which
      at the time of the wife&rsquo;s death was little short of <em>�</em>1100, is now, through the fall in agricultural
      prices, not more than <em>�</em>750. Each daughter can claim an income of <em>�</em>250, in case of marriage. It is
      evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of
      them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning&rsquo;s work has not been wasted, since it has proved
      that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is
      too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so
      if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your
      revolver into your pocket. An Eley&rsquo;s No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel
      pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and
      drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few
      fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and
      the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast between the
      sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in the front of
      the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the
      deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo;  said he.</p>

      <p>A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid
      the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Stoke Moran?&rdquo;  said he.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,&rdquo;  remarked the driver.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There is some building going on there,&rdquo;  said Holmes; &ldquo;that is where we are
      going.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the village,&rdquo;  said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the
      left; &ldquo;but if you want to get to the house, you&rsquo;ll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by
      the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,&rdquo;  observed Holmes, shading his eyes. &ldquo;Yes, I think we
      had better do as you suggest.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.</p>
