      <p>I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. &ldquo;It is both, or
      none,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. &ldquo;Then I must begin,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;by binding you both to
      absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not
      too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo;  said Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And I.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You will excuse this mask,&rdquo;  continued our strange visitor. &ldquo;The august person who employs me
      wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself
      is not exactly my own.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was aware of it,&rdquo;  said Holmes dryly.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow
      to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the
      matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was also aware of that,&rdquo;  murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his
      eyes.</p>

      <p>Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no
      doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his
      eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,&rdquo;  he remarked, &ldquo;I should be better able
      to advise you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture
      of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo;  he
      cried; &ldquo;I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why, indeed?&rdquo;  murmured Holmes. &ldquo;Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was
      addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of
      Bohemia.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But you can understand,&rdquo;  said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand
      over his high white forehead, &ldquo;you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own
      person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his
      power. I have come <em>incognito</em> from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then, pray consult,&rdquo;  said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the
      acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,&rdquo;  murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years
      he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a
      subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography
      sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the
      deep-sea fishes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Let me see!&rdquo;  said Holmes. &ldquo;Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto&#8212;hum! La
      Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw&#8212;yes! Retired from operatic stage&#8212;ha! Living in
      London&#8212;quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some
      compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Precisely so. But how&#8212;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Was there a secret marriage?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No legal papers or certificates?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or
      other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;There is the writing.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pooh, pooh! Forgery.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My private note-paper.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Stolen.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My own seal.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Imitated.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My photograph.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Bought.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;We were both in the photograph.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was mad&#8212;insane.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have compromised yourself seriously.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It must be recovered.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;We have tried and failed.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;She will not sell.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Stolen, then.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage
      when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No sign of it?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Absolutely none.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes laughed. &ldquo;It is quite a pretty little problem,&rdquo;  said he.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;But a very serious one to me,&rdquo;  returned the King reproachfully.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;To ruin me.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am about to be married.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;So I have heard.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the
      strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct
      would bring the matter to an end.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And Irene Adler?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know
      her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most
      resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not
      go&#8212;none.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You are sure that she has not sent it yet?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am sure.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo; </p>
