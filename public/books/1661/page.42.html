      <p>&ldquo;It is possible.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And you thought he was pulled back?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He disappeared so suddenly.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the room?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the Lascar was at the foot of the
      stairs.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear.
      We shall now have a little supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, and I was quickly between the
      sheets, for I was weary after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an
      unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging
      his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his
      data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off
      his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows
      from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon
      which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of
      him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed
      vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light
      shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden
      ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still
      between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing
      remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Awake, Watson?&rdquo;  he asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Game for a morning drive?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the
      trap out.&rdquo;  He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the
      sombre thinker of the previous night.</p>

      <p>As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past
      four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I want to test a little theory of mine,&rdquo;  said he, pulling on his boots. &ldquo;I think, Watson,
      that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from
      here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And where is it?&rdquo;  I asked, smiling.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;In the bathroom,&rdquo;  he answered. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I am not joking,&rdquo;  he continued, seeing my
      look of incredulity. &ldquo;I have just been there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone
      bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood
      our horse and trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and away we dashed down
      the London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of
      villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It has been in some points a singular case,&rdquo;  said Holmes, flicking the horse on into a gallop.
      &ldquo;I confess that I have been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it
      at all.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the
      streets of the Surrey side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and dashing up
      Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known
      to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the horse&rsquo;s head while the
      other led us in.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Who is on duty?&rdquo;  asked Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Inspector Bradstreet, sir.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?&rdquo;  A tall, stout official had come down the stone-flagged passage, in a
      peaked cap and frogged jacket. &ldquo;I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Certainly,
      Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.&rdquo;  It was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,
      and a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his desk.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I called about that beggarman, Boone&#8212;the one who was charged with being concerned in the
      disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;So I heard. You have him here?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;In the cells.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Is he quiet?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Dirty?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker&rsquo;s. Well,
      when once his case has been settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would
      agree with me that he needed it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I should like to see him very much.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, I think that I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very good. Come this way, if you please.&rdquo;  He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed
      down a winding stair, and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The third on the right is his,&rdquo;  said the inspector. &ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo;  He quietly shot back
      a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through.</p>
