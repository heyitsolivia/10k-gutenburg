      <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, &ldquo;it
      has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I
      gained?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Experience,&rdquo;  said Holmes, laughing. &ldquo;Indirectly it may be of value, you know; you have only
        to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your
        existence.&rdquo;

      </p>

      <p>The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those
      exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and their more piquant
      details have drawn the gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the
      full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable
      share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this
      remarkable episode.</p>

      <p>It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker
      Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. I had remained
      indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the Jezail bullet
      which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence. With
      my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at
      last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and
      monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend&rsquo;s noble correspondent could
      be.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Here is a very fashionable epistle,&rdquo;  I remarked as he entered. &ldquo;Your morning letters, if I
      remember right, were from a fish-monger and a tide-waiter.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,&rdquo;  he answered, smiling, &ldquo;and the
      humbler are usually the more interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon
      a man either to be bored or to lie.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not social, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, distinctly professional.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And from a noble client?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;One of the highest in England.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, I congratulate you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me
      than the interest of his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new
      investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late, have you not?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It looks like it,&rdquo;  said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the corner. &ldquo;I have had
      nothing else to do.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except the criminal news and
      the agony column. The latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely you must
      have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in
      return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he says:</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:&#8212;Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit
      reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in
      reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland
      Yard, is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, and that
      he even thinks that it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and,
      should you have any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of
      paramount importance. Yours faithfully,</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;ST. SIMON.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the noble lord has had the misfortune
      to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger,&rdquo;  remarked Holmes as he folded up the
      epistle.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;He says four o&rsquo;clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the subject. Turn over those papers and
      arrange the extracts in their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.&rdquo;  He picked a
      red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece. &ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo;  said he,
      sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee. &ldquo;&lsquo;Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon,
      second son of the Duke of Balmoral.&rsquo; Hum! &lsquo;Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable.
      Born in 1846.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for the
      colonies in a late administration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They
      inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very
      instructive in all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;for the facts are quite
      recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an
      inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up
      now&#8212;though, indeed, it was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper
      selections.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal column of the <em>Morning Post</em>, and
      dates, as you see, some weeks back: &lsquo;A marriage has been arranged,&rsquo; it says, &lsquo;and will, if
      rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and
      Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.&rsquo; That is
      all.&rdquo; </p>
