      <p>&ldquo;It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not of a business
      turn. He was wild, wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money.
      When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the
      intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards and to
      squander money on the turf, until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon
      his allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried more than once to break away from the dangerous
      company which he was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw
      him back again.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over
      him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the
      fascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been
      everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in
      cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I
      have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so, too, thinks my little
      Mary, who has a woman&rsquo;s quick insight into character.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago and
      left her alone in the world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in
      my house&#8212;sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle
      as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In only one matter has she
      ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time
      she has refused him. I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she, and
      that his marriage might have changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late&#8212;forever too late!</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I shall continue with my miserable
      story.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my
      experience, and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my client. Lucy
      Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.
      Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb
      it.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where have you put it?&rsquo; asked Arthur.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In my own bureau.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I hope to goodness the house won&rsquo;t be burgled during the night.&rsquo; said
      he.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is locked up,&rsquo; I answered.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with
      the key of the box-room cupboard.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what he said. He followed me to my room,
      however, that night with a very grave face.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, dad,&rsquo; said he with his eyes cast down, &lsquo;can you let me have
      <em>ï¿½</em>200?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I cannot!&rsquo; I answered sharply. &lsquo;I have been far too generous with you in
      money matters.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have been very kind,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but I must have this money, or else I can
      never show my face inside the club again.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And a very good thing, too!&rsquo; I cried.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I could
      not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try
      other means.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. &lsquo;You shall not have a farthing
      from me,&rsquo; I cried, on which he bowed and left the room without another word.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I
      started to go round the house to see that all was secure&#8212;a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I
      thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of
      the hall, which she closed and fastened as I approached.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell me, dad,&rsquo; said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, &lsquo;did you give
      Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Certainly not.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has only been to the side
      gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that
      everything is fastened?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Quite sure, dad.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then, good-night.&rsquo; I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon
      asleep.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have any bearing upon the case, but I
      beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy
      sleeper, and the anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in the
      morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an
      impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly,
      to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all
      palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Arthur!&rsquo; I screamed, &lsquo;you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that
      coronet?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was
      standing beside the light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it with
      all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I snatched it up and
      examined it. One of the gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.</p>
