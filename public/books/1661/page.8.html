      <p>&ldquo;MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,&#8212;You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after
      the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I
      had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be
      you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even
      after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have
      been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which
      it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and
      came down just as you departed.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the
      celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to
      see my husband.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will
      find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am
      loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
      wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps
      which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr.
      Sherlock Holmes,</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very truly yours,       &ldquo;IRENE NORTON, <em>nï¿½e</em>
      ADLER.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What a woman&#8212;oh, what a woman!&rdquo;  cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this
      epistle. &ldquo;Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is
      it not a pity that she was not on my level?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your
      Majesty,&rdquo;  said Holmes coldly. &ldquo;I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty&rsquo;s
      business to a more successful conclusion.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;On the contrary, my dear sir,&rdquo;  cried the King; &ldquo;nothing could be more successful. I know
      that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring&#8212;&rdquo;  He
      slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,&rdquo;  said Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have but to name it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;This photograph!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The King stared at him in amazement.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Irene&rsquo;s photograph!&rdquo;  he cried. &ldquo;Certainly, if you wish it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a
      very good morning.&rdquo;  He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out
      to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.</p>

      <p>
        And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr.
        Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman&rsquo;s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I
        have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is
        always under the honourable title of <em>the</em> woman.

        <h2 class="chapter-break"><a name="2">ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE</a></h2>
      </p>

      <p>Ihad called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep
      conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my
      intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind
      me.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,&rdquo;  he said cordially.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was afraid that you were engaged.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;So I am. Very much so.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then I can wait in the next room.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful
      cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance
      from his small fat-encircled eyes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Try the settee,&rdquo;  said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as
      was his custom when in judicial moods. &ldquo;I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is
      bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the
      enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so
      many of my own little adventures.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,&rdquo;  I observed.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem
      presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life
      itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling
      fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez
      Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one
      of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most
      unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed,
      where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is
      impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is
      certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great
      kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening
      part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your
      lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by
      the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that
      the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.&rdquo; </p>
