      <p>&ldquo;You know me, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have
      started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the
      station.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There is no mystery, my dear madam,&rdquo;  said he, smiling. &ldquo;The left arm of your jacket is
      spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a
      dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the
      driver.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,&rdquo;  said she. &ldquo;I started from home
      before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this
      strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to&#8212;none, save only one, who cares
      for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.
      Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you
      not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which
      surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I
      shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me
      ungrateful.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Farintosh,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I
      think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to
      your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty
      to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay
      before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;  replied our visitor, &ldquo;the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears
      are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that
      even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it
      as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted
      eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You
      may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am all attention, madam.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the
      oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes nodded his head. &ldquo;The name is familiar to me,&rdquo;  said he.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into
      Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a
      dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the
      Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed
      under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an
      aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,
      obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where,
      by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however,
      caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly
      escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England
      a morose and disappointed man.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General
      Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of
      my mother&rsquo;s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money&#8212;not less than <em>ï¿½</em>1000 a
      year&#8212;and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a
      certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to
      England my mother died&#8212;she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then
      abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old
      ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed
      to be no obstacle to our happiness.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging
      visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family
      seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might
      cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my
      stepfather&rsquo;s case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of
      disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the
      village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely
      uncontrollable in his anger.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over
      all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at
      all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of
      bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents,
      wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over
      to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds
      and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.</p>
