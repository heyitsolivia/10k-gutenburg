      <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road&#8212;249,&rdquo;  read Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes turned to the page indicated. &ldquo;Here you are, &lsquo;Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and
      poultry supplier.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Now, then, what&rsquo;s the last entry?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7<em>s</em>. 6<em>d</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Quite so. There you are. And underneath?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12<em>s</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What have you to say now?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab,
      turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a
      lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the &lsquo;Pink &rsquo;un&rsquo; protruding out of his
      pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;I daresay that if I had put <em>ï¿½</em>100 down in
      front of him, that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he
      was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which
      remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve
      it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are
      anxious about the matter, and I should&#8212;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left.
      Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was
      thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his
      fists fiercely at the cringing figure.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of you and your geese,&rdquo;  he shouted. &ldquo;I wish you were all at the devil
      together. If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I&rsquo;ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs.
      Oakshott here and I&rsquo;ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese off you?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No; but one of them was mine all the same,&rdquo;  whined the little man.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;She told me to ask you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I&rsquo;ve had enough of it. Get out of
      this!&rdquo;  He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,&rdquo;  whispered Holmes. &ldquo;Come with me, and we will
      see what is to be made of this fellow.&rdquo;  Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the
      flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang round,
      and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Who are you, then? What do you want?&rdquo;  he asked in a quavering voice.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You will excuse me,&rdquo;  said Holmes blandly, &ldquo;but I could not help overhearing the questions
      which you put to the salesman just now. I think that I could be of assistance to you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But you can know nothing of this?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs.
      Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the Alpha, and by
      him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,&rdquo;  cried the little fellow with
      outstretched hands and quivering fingers. &ldquo;I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this
      matter.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. &ldquo;In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy
      room rather than in this wind-swept market-place,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;But pray tell me, before we go farther,
      who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The man hesitated for an instant. &ldquo;My name is John Robinson,&rdquo;  he answered with a sidelong
      glance.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, no; the real name,&rdquo;  said Holmes sweetly. &ldquo;It is always awkward doing business with an
      alias.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;my real name is
      James Ryder.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able
      to tell you everything which you would wish to know.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who
      is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into the cab, and in
      half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the
      high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous
      tension within him.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo;  said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. &ldquo;The fire looks very
      seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers
      before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what became of those geese?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested&#8212;white,
      with a black bar across the tail.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Ryder quivered with emotion. &ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo;  he cried, &ldquo;can you tell me where it went
      to?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It came here.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don&rsquo;t wonder that you should take an interest in it.
      It laid an egg after it was dead&#8212;the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here
      in my museum.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his
      strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed
      radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.</p>
