      <p>&ldquo;Holmes!&rdquo;  I whispered, &ldquo;what on earth are you doing in this den?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;As low as you can,&rdquo;  he answered; &ldquo;I have excellent ears. If you would have the great
      kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with
      you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have a cab outside.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any
      mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in
      your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with you in five minutes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes&rsquo; requests, for they were always so exceedingly
      definite, and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined
      in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be
      associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In
      a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney&rsquo;s bill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven
      through the darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I was walking
      down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.
      Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I suppose, Watson,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;that you imagine that I have added opium-smoking to cocaine
      injections, and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was certainly surprised to find you there.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But not more so than I to find you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I came to find a friend.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And I to find an enemy.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;An enemy?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of
      a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have
      done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour&rsquo;s purchase; for
      I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance
      upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul&rsquo;s Wharf, which could
      tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What! You do not mean bodies?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had <em>�</em>1000 for every poor devil who has been done
      to death in that den. It is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St. Clair has
      entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.&rdquo;  He put his two forefingers between his
      teeth and whistled shrilly&#8212;a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed
      shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses&rsquo; hoofs.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Now, Watson,&rdquo;  said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden
      tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come with me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;If I can be of use.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so. My room at The Cedars is a
      double-bedded one.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The Cedars?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair&rsquo;s house. I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Where is it, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But I am all in the dark.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Of course you are. You&rsquo;ll know all about it presently. Jump up here. All right, John; we shall not
      need you. Here&rsquo;s half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long,
      then!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted
      streets, which widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with the murky river
      flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by
      the heavy, regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers. A dull
      wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the
      clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought,
      while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely,
      and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to
      get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his
      pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;It makes you quite invaluable as a
      companion. &rsquo;Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not
      over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the
      door.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You forget that I know nothing about it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple,
      and yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There&rsquo;s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can&rsquo;t get the
      end of it into my hand. Now, I&rsquo;ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see
      a spark where all is dark to me.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Proceed, then.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Some years ago&#8212;to be definite, in May, 1884&#8212;there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair
      by name, who appeared to have plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and lived
      generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a
      local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies and
      went into town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is
      now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man
      who is popular with all who know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far as we have been
      able to ascertain, amount to <em>�</em>88 10<em>s</em>., while he has <em>�</em>220 standing to his credit in the
      Capital and Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his
      mind.</p>
