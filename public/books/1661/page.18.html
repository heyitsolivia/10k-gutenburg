      <p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo;  said Holmes, &ldquo;that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed
      at your having gone to the ball.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there
      was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I see. Then at the gasfitters&rsquo; ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer
      Angel.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after
      that we met him&#8212;that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back
      again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, you know father didn&rsquo;t like anything of the sort. He wouldn&rsquo;t have any visitors if he
      could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to
      say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer
      and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every
      day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer&#8212;Mr. Angel&#8212;was
      a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street&#8212;and&#8212;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What office?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Where did he live, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He slept on the premises.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t know his address?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No&#8212;except that it was Leadenhall Street.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Where did you address your letters, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the
      office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite
      them, like he did his, but he wouldn&rsquo;t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come
      from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show
      you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It was most suggestive,&rdquo;  said Holmes. &ldquo;It has long been an axiom of mine that the little
      things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer
      Angel?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for
      he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle.
      He&rsquo;d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak
      throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his
      eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He
      was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always
      be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was
      all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within
      the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him
      afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn&rsquo;t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It
      seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn&rsquo;t want to do
      anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter
      came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It missed him, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in
      church?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour&rsquo;s, near King&rsquo;s Cross, and we were to
      have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he
      put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the
      street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never
      did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could
      not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr.
      Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,&rdquo;  said Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that,
      whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was
      always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed
      strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to
      him?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think
      that what he foresaw happened.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But you have no notion as to what it could have been?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;One more question. How did your mother take the matter?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.&rdquo; </p>
