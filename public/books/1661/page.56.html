      <p>&ldquo;I thought it as well,&rdquo;  said Holmes as we climbed the stile, &ldquo;that this fellow should think
      we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.
      You see that we have been as good as our word.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy. &ldquo;I have been
      waiting so eagerly for you,&rdquo;  she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. &ldquo;All has turned out splendidly.
      Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;We have had the pleasure of making the doctor&rsquo;s acquaintance,&rdquo;  said Holmes, and in a few
      words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo;  she cried, &ldquo;he has followed me, then.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;So it appears.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he
      returns?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track.
      You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt&rsquo;s at
      Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to
      examine.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the
      claws of a crab, thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden
      boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair,
      but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up
      from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against the
      end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our
      visit. Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the
      windows.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister&rsquo;s,
      and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott&rsquo;s chamber?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need
      for repairs at that end wall.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these
      three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you
      have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way
      to force the shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise
      the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive
      masonry. &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo;  said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, &ldquo;my theory certainly presents
      some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws
      any light upon the matter.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to
      examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in
      which her sister had met with her fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace,
      after the fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned
      bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small
      wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The
      boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have
      dated from the original building of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while
      his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Where does that bell communicate with?&rdquo;  he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung
      down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It goes to the housekeeper&rsquo;s room.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It looks newer than the other things?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Your sister asked for it, I suppose?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes
      while I satisfy myself as to this floor.&rdquo;  He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and
      crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with
      the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in
      staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a
      brisk tug.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a dummy,&rdquo;  said he.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it ring?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to
      a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;How very absurd! I never noticed that before.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very strange!&rdquo;  muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. &ldquo;There are one or two very singular
      points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when,
      with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is also quite modern,&rdquo;  said the lady.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Done about the same time as the bell-rope?&rdquo;  remarked Holmes.</p>
