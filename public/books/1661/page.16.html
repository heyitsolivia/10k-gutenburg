      <p>&ldquo;So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement
      with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I
      rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes
      upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have
      remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining
      point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our
      friend&rsquo;s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called
      upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?&rdquo;  I asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez
      Wilson&rsquo;s presence&#8212;in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they
      should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better
      than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come
      to-night.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You reasoned it out beautifully,&rdquo;  I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. &ldquo;It is so long a
      chain, and yet every link rings true.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It saved me from ennui,&rdquo;  he answered, yawning. &ldquo;Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me.
      My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to
      do so.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And you are a benefactor of the race,&rdquo;  said I.</p>

      <p>
        He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,&rdquo;  he remarked.
        &ldquo;&lsquo;<em>L&rsquo;homme c&rsquo;est rien&#8212;l&rsquo;oeuvre c&rsquo;est tout</em>,&rsquo; as
        Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.&rdquo;

        <h2 class="chapter-break"><a name="3">ADVENTURE III. A CASE OF IDENTITY</a></h2>
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo;  said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at
      Baker Street, &ldquo;life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not
      dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window
      hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going
      on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through
      generations, and leading to the most <em>outrï¿½</em> results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities
      and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And yet I am not convinced of it,&rdquo;  I answered. &ldquo;The cases which come to light in the papers
      are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme
      limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,&rdquo;  remarked Holmes.
      &ldquo;This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the
      magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon
      it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I smiled and shook my head. &ldquo;I can quite understand your thinking so,&rdquo;  I said. &ldquo;Of course, in
      your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three
      continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here&rdquo; &#8212;I picked up the
      morning paper from the ground&#8212;&ldquo;let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which
      I come. &lsquo;A husband&rsquo;s cruelty to his wife.&rsquo; There is half a column of print, but I know without
      reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the
      blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more
      crude.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,&rdquo;  said Holmes, taking the paper and
      glancing his eye down it. &ldquo;This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing
      up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the
      conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false
      teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of
      the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your
      example.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such
      contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from
      the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And the ring?&rdquo;  I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such
      delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little
      problems.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And have you any on hand just now?&rdquo;  I asked with interest.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand,
      without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field
      for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The
      larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In
      these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing
      which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very
      many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.&rdquo; </p>
