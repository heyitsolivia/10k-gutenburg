      <p>&ldquo;Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That
      will be next Monday.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, then we have three days yet,&rdquo;  said Holmes with a yawn. &ldquo;That is very fortunate, as I
      have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London
      for the present?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then, as to money?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have <em>carte blanche</em>.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Absolutely?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And for present expenses?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,&rdquo;  he said.</p>

      <p>Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And Mademoiselle&rsquo;s address?&rdquo;  he asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John&rsquo;s Wood.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes took a note of it. &ldquo;One other question,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;Was the photograph a
      cabinet?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And
      good-night, Watson,&rdquo;  he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. &ldquo;If you
      will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o&rsquo;clock I should like to chat this little matter
      over with you.&rdquo; II.</p>

      <p>At three o&rsquo;clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed
      me that he had left the house shortly after eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire,
      however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his
      inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two
      crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it
      a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was
      something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me
      to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most
      inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had
      ceased to enter into my head.</p>

      <p>It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with
      an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend&rsquo;s amazing
      powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod
      he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting
      his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some
      minutes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, really!&rdquo;  he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back,
      limp and helpless, in the chair.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended
      by doing.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss
      Irene Adler.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after
      eight o&rsquo;clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and
      freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony
      Lodge. It is a <em>bijou</em> villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two
      stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to
      the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing
      remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and
      examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down
      by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange
      twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about
      Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least
      interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And what of Irene Adler?&rdquo;  I asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, she has turned all the men&rsquo;s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a
      bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at
      five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has
      only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a
      day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a
      confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had
      listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my
      plan of campaign.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded
      ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his
      friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter,
      it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or
      turn my attention to the gentleman&rsquo;s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the
      field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties,
      if you are to understand the situation.&rdquo; </p>
