      <p>&ldquo;Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and changed my clothes. It was a delicate
      part which I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I knew that so
      astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he
      denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a
      life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.
      Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he
      held&#8212;<em>�</em>1000 apiece. That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. &lsquo;Why, dash it
      all!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve let them go at six hundred for the three!&rsquo; I soon managed to get the
      address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and
      after much chaffering I got our stones at <em>�</em>1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all
      was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o&rsquo;clock, after what I may call a really hard day&rsquo;s
      work.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,&rdquo;  said the banker, rising. &ldquo;Sir, I
      cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed
      exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I
      have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me
      where she is now.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I think that we may safely say,&rdquo;  returned Holmes, &ldquo;that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell
        is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient
        punishment.&rdquo;

        <h2 class="chapter-break"><a name="12">XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES</a></h2>
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;To the man who loves art for its own sake,&rdquo;  remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside the
      advertisement sheet of the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, &ldquo;it is frequently in its least important and lowliest
      manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have
      so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up,
      and, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many <em>causes
      c�l�bres</em> and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
      trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I
      have made my special province.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo;  said I, smiling, &ldquo;I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of
      sensationalism which has been urged against my records.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have erred, perhaps,&rdquo;  he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with
      it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a
      meditative mood&#8212;&ldquo;you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your
      statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to
      effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,&rdquo;  I remarked with some coldness,
      for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend&rsquo;s
      singular character.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, it is not selfishness or conceit,&rdquo;  said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather
      than my words. &ldquo;If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing&#8212;a thing
      beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you
      should dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the
      old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing
      windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit and shone on the white
      cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent all
      the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having
      apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary
      shortcomings.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;At the same time,&rdquo;  he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and
      gazing down into the fire, &ldquo;you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases
      which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal
      sense, at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of
      Miss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the incident of the noble
      bachelor, were all matters which are outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear that you
      may have bordered on the trivial.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The end may have been so,&rdquo;  I answered, &ldquo;but the methods I hold to have been novel and of
      interest.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver
      by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction! But,
      indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at least
      criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating
      into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think
      that I have touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read
      it!&rdquo;  He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.</p>

      <p>It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran thus:</p>
