      <p>&ldquo;It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being
      able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our
      depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security is
      unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and there are many noble
      families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the
      clerks. I started when I saw the name, for it was that of none other than&#8212;well, perhaps even to you I had
      better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth&#8212;one of the highest,
      noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so,
      but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable
      task.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Holder,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I have been informed that you are in the habit of
      advancing money.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The firm does so when the security is good.&rsquo; I answered.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is absolutely essential to me,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that I should have <em>�</em>50,000
      at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it
      a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is
      unwise to place one&rsquo;s self under obligations.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?&rsquo; I asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most certainly repay what you
      advance, with whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should
      be paid at once.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,&rsquo;
      said I, &lsquo;were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to
      do it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every
      businesslike precaution should be taken.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should much prefer to have it so,&rsquo; said he, raising up a square, black morocco case
      which he had laid beside his chair. &lsquo;You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,&rsquo; said I.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Precisely.&rsquo; He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet,
      lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named. &lsquo;There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,&rsquo;
      said he, &lsquo;and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would put the worth of the
      coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my security.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious
      client.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You doubt its value?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not at all. I only doubt&#8212;&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not
      dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure
      matter of form. Is the security sufficient?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ample.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I
      have in you, founded upon all that I have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain
      from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I
      need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be
      almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the world to match these, and it would be
      impossible to replace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall call for it in person
      on Monday morning.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to
      pay over fifty <em>�</em>1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon the
      table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed
      upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any
      misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it. However, it was too
      late to alter the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office
      behind me. Bankers&rsquo; safes had been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would
      be the position in which I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always
      carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of my reach. With this
      intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe
      freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation. My
      groom and my page sleep out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants who have
      been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the
      second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent character, however, and
      has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung
      about the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good
      girl in every way.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I
      am a widower and have an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes&#8212;a grievous
      disappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very likely I
      have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for
      a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I
      been sterner, but I meant it for the best.</p>
