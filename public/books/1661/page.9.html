      <p>The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled
      newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head
      thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the
      fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.</p>

      <p>I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average
      commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd&rsquo;s check
      trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy
      Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown
      overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing
      remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his
      features.</p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes&rsquo; quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my
      questioning glances. &ldquo;Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes
      snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing
      lately, I can deduce nothing else.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my
      companion.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?&rdquo;  he asked. &ldquo;How did you
      know, for example, that I did manual labour. It&rsquo;s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship&rsquo;s
      carpenter.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it,
      and the muscles are more developed.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the
      strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the
      smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, but China?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I
      have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of
      staining the fishes&rsquo; scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a
      Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. &ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;I thought at first that you had
      done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I begin to think, Watson,&rdquo;  said Holmes, &ldquo;that I make a mistake in explaining. &lsquo;<em>Omne
      ignotum pro magnifico</em>,&rsquo; you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if
      I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have got it now,&rdquo;  he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column.
      &ldquo;Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>I took the paper from him and read as follows:</p>

      <p>&ldquo;TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon,
      Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of
      <em>�</em>4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age
      of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o&rsquo;clock, to Duncan Ross, at the
      offices of the League, 7 Pope&rsquo;s Court, Fleet Street.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What on earth does this mean?&rdquo;  I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary
      announcement.</p>

      <p>Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. &ldquo;It is a little off the
      beaten track, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all
      about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first
      make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is <em>The Morning Chronicle</em> of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&rdquo;  said Jabez Wilson, mopping his
      forehead; &ldquo;I have a small pawnbroker&rsquo;s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It&rsquo;s not a very
      large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two
      assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half
      wages so as to learn the business.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What is the name of this obliging youth?&rdquo;  asked Sherlock Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he&rsquo;s not such a youth, either. It&rsquo;s hard to say his age.
      I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn
      twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his
      head?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employ� who comes under the full market price. It is
      not a common experience among employers in this age. I don&rsquo;t know that your assistant is not as remarkable
      as your advertisement.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, he has his faults, too,&rdquo;  said Mr. Wilson. &ldquo;Never was such a fellow for photography.
      Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a
      rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he&rsquo;s a good worker.
      There&rsquo;s no vice in him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He is still with you, I presume?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place
      clean&#8212;that&rsquo;s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very
      quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.</p>
