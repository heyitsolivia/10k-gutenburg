      <p>&ldquo;Entirely.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by means of
      the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to remove the
      pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty
      parties.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo;  said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat. &ldquo;You have given me
      fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you advise.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the meanwhile, for I do not think that
      there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;By train from Waterloo.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. And yet you
      cannot guard yourself too closely.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am armed.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I shall see you at Horsham, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to the box and the papers. I shall
      take your advice in every particular.&rdquo;  He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside the wind still
      screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come to
      us from amid the mad elements&#8212;blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale&#8212;and now to have been
      reabsorbed by them once more.</p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of
      the fire. Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each
      other up to the ceiling.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I think, Watson,&rdquo;  he remarked at last, &ldquo;that of all our cases we have had none more
      fantastic than this.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater
      perils than did the Sholtos.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But have you,&rdquo;  I asked, &ldquo;formed any definite conception as to what these perils
      are?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;There can be no question as to their nature,&rdquo;  he answered.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this unhappy family?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair, with his finger-tips
      together. &ldquo;The ideal reasoner,&rdquo;  he remarked, &ldquo;would, when he had once been shown a single fact
      in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results
      which would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single
      bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately
      state all the other ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can
      attain to. Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid
      of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able
      to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a
      possession of all knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare
      accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be
      useful to him in his work, and this I have endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one
      occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I answered, laughing. &ldquo;It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, and politics
      were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region
      within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records
      unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were
      the main points of my analysis.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes grinned at the last item. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;I say now, as I said then, that a man
      should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can
      put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one
      which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand me down the
      letter K of the <em>American Encyclopaedia</em> which stands upon the shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us
      consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong
      presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not
      change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English
      provincial town. His extreme love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or
      something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from
      America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were
      received by himself and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those letters?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third from London.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;From East London. What do you deduce from that?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that the probability&#8212;the strong
      probability&#8212;is that the writer was on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of
      Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four
      days. Does that suggest anything?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;A greater distance to travel.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But the letter had also a greater distance to come.&rdquo; </p>
