      <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,&rdquo;  said Jones in his consequential way.
      &ldquo;Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the
      running down.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,&rdquo;  observed Mr. Merryweather
      gloomily.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,&rdquo;  said the police agent loftily.
      &ldquo;He has his own little methods, which are, if he won&rsquo;t mind my saying so, just a little too
      theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or
      twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the
      official force.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,&rdquo;  said the stranger with deference. &ldquo;Still, I
      confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my
      rubber.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I think you will find,&rdquo;  said Sherlock Holmes, &ldquo;that you will play for a higher stake
      to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the
      stake will be some <em>�</em>30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your
      hands.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He&rsquo;s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is
      at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London.
      He&rsquo;s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton
      and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know
      where to find the man himself. He&rsquo;ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an
      orphanage in Cornwall the next. I&rsquo;ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him
      yet.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I&rsquo;ve had one or two little turns
      also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,
      and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the
      second.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes
      which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged
      into Farrington Street.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;We are close there now,&rdquo;  my friend remarked. &ldquo;This fellow Merryweather is a bank director,
      and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow,
      though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as
      tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were
      dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side
      door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This
      also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr.
      Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after
      opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You are not very vulnerable from above,&rdquo;  Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about
      him.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Nor from below,&rdquo;  said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor.
      &ldquo;Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!&rdquo;  he remarked, looking up in surprise.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!&rdquo;  said Holmes severely. &ldquo;You have already
      imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one
      of those boxes, and not to interfere?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while
      Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely
      the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his
      glass in his pocket.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;We have at least an hour before us,&rdquo;  he remarked, &ldquo;for they can hardly take any steps until
      the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the
      longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor&#8212;as no doubt you have divined&#8212;in
      the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors,
      and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a
      considerable interest in this cellar at present.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is our French gold,&rdquo;  whispered the director. &ldquo;We have had several warnings that an
      attempt might be made upon it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Your French gold?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000
      napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and
      that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of
      lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and
      the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Which were very well justified,&rdquo;  observed Holmes. &ldquo;And now it is time that we arranged our
      little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must
      put the screen over that dark lantern.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And sit in the dark?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a <em>partie
      carr�e</em>, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy&rsquo;s preparations have gone so far
      that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring
      men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall
      stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close
      in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.&rdquo; </p>
