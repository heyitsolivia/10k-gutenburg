      <p>&ldquo;Except yourself I have none,&rdquo;  he answered. &ldquo;I do not encourage visitors.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;A client, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I
      take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady&rsquo;s.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the
      door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a
      newcomer must sit.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;  said he.</p>

      <p>The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something
      of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining
      waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the
      lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some
      great anxiety.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I owe you an apology,&rdquo;  he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. &ldquo;I trust that I am
      not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Give me your coat and umbrella,&rdquo;  said Holmes. &ldquo;They may rest here on the hook and will be
      dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, from Horsham.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have come for advice.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is easily got.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And help.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is not always so easy.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville
      Club scandal.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He said that you could solve anything.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He said too much.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That you are never beaten.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have been beaten four times&#8212;three times by men, and once by a woman.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But what is that compared with the number of your successes?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is true that I have been generally successful.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then you may be so with me.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your
      case.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is no ordinary one.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious
      and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You fill me with interest,&rdquo;  said Holmes. &ldquo;Pray give us the essential facts from the
      commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most
      important.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand,
      little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I
      must go back to the commencement of the affair.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You must know that my grandfather had two sons&#8212;my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had
      a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the
      Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a
      handsome competence.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he
      was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson&rsquo;s army, and afterwards
      under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where
      he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex,
      near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his
      aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a
      singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition.
      During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or
      three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would
      never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did
      not want any friends, not even his own brother.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a
      youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He
      begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be
      fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants
      and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the
      keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was
      one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably
      locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy&rsquo;s curiosity I have
      peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as
      would be expected in such a room.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;One day&#8212;it was in March, 1883&#8212;a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of
      the colonel&rsquo;s plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in
      ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. &lsquo;From India!&rsquo; said he as he took it up,
      &lsquo;Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?&rsquo; Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried
      orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips
      at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he
      glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, &lsquo;K. K. K.!&rsquo; he shrieked, and then,
      &lsquo;My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!&rsquo;</p>
