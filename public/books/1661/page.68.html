      <p>&ldquo;Terse and to the point,&rdquo;  remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards the fire.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week. Ah, here it is:
      &lsquo;There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle
      appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain
      is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during
      the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who
      has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god&rsquo;s arrows, has now definitely announced
      his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss Doran,
      whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only
      child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures, with
      expectancies for the future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his
      pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of
      Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her
      to make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;  asked Holmes, yawning.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the <em>Morning Post</em> to say that the marriage would be
      an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George&rsquo;s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate
      friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been
      taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later&#8212;that is, on Wednesday last&#8212;there is a curt announcement
      that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater&rsquo;s place, near
      Petersfield. Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Before the what?&rdquo;  asked Holmes with a start.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The vanishing of the lady.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;When did she vanish, then?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;At the wedding breakfast.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind
      anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I warn you that they are very incomplete.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Perhaps we may make them less so.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will
      read to you. It is headed, &lsquo;Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding&rsquo;:</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the
      strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly
      announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been
      possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts
      of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can
      be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The ceremony, which was performed at St. George&rsquo;s, Hanover Square, was a very quiet
      one, no one being present save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord
      Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady
      Alicia Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate,
      where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not
      been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had
      some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler
      and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat
      down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her
      prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only
      come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the
      footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was
      his mistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr.
      Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and
      very energetic inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular
      business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady.
      There are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman
      who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been
      concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And is that all?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And it is&#8212;&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears
      that she was formerly a <em>danseuse</em> at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.
      There are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands now&#8212;so far as it has been set forth in
      the public press.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have missed it for worlds. But there
      is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this will
      prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a
      check to my own memory.&rdquo; </p>
