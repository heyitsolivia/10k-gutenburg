      <p>The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance,
      and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had
      been offered to him.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, then?&rdquo;  asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;You look
      dissatisfied.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail
      of the business.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Really! You surprise me.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I have been at work
      upon it all day.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And very wet it seems to have made you,&rdquo;  said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the
      pea-jacket.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;In heaven&rsquo;s name, what for?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?&rdquo;  he asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why? What do you mean?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. &ldquo;I suppose you know all about it,&rdquo;  he snarled.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I think it very unlikely.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?&rdquo;  He opened his bag as he
      spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride&rsquo;s
      wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. &ldquo;There,&rdquo;  said he, putting a new wedding-ring
      upon the top of the pile. &ldquo;There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo;  said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. &ldquo;You dragged them from the
      Serpentine?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They have been identified as her clothes,
      and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;By the same brilliant reasoning, every man&rsquo;s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his
      wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am afraid that you will find it difficult.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Are you, indeed, now?&rdquo;  cried Lestrade with some bitterness. &ldquo;I am afraid, Holmes, that you
      are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.
      This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And how?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the card-case is a note. And here is the very
      note.&rdquo;  He slapped it down upon the table in front of him. &ldquo;Listen to this: &lsquo;You will see me when
      all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.&rsquo; Now my theory all along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away
      by Flora Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed
      with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured
      her within their reach.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very good, Lestrade,&rdquo;  said Holmes, laughing. &ldquo;You really are very fine indeed. Let me see
      it.&rdquo;  He took up the paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a
      little cry of satisfaction. &ldquo;This is indeed important,&rdquo;  said he.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ha! you find it so?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo;  he shrieked, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
      looking at the wrong side!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;On the contrary, this is the right side.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The right side? You&rsquo;re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over here.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill, which interests me deeply.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in it. I looked at it before,&rdquo;  said Lestrade. &ldquo;&lsquo;Oct. 4th,
      rooms 8<em>s</em>., breakfast 2<em>s</em>. 6<em>d</em>., cocktail 1<em>s</em>., lunch 2<em>s</em>. 6<em>d</em>., glass sherry,
      8<em>d</em>.&rsquo; I see nothing in that.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note, it is important also, or at least
      the initials are, so I congratulate you again.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wasted time enough,&rdquo;  said Lestrade, rising. &ldquo;I believe in hard work and not in
      sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the
      matter first.&rdquo;  He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made for the door.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Just one hint to you, Lestrade,&rdquo;  drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; &ldquo;I will tell you
      the true solution of the matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such
      person.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head
      solemnly, and hurried away.</p>

      <p>He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. &ldquo;There is something in
      what the fellow says about outdoor work,&rdquo;  he remarked, &ldquo;so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to
      your papers for a little.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>It was after five o&rsquo;clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an
      hour there arrived a confectioner&rsquo;s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a
      youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold
      supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock,
      a pheasant, a <em>p�t� de foie gras</em> pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these
      luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with no explanation save that the
      things had been paid for and were ordered to this address.</p>
