      <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo;  said I as I glanced down the column, &ldquo;that the coroner in his concluding remarks was
      rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having
      signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and
      his singular account of his father&rsquo;s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the
      son.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. &ldquo;Both you and the
      coroner have been at some pains,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;to single out the very strongest points in the young
      man&rsquo;s favour. Don&rsquo;t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and
      too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury;
      too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so <em>outrï¿½</em> as a dying reference to a rat,
      and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this
      young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch,
      and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see
      that we shall be there in twenty minutes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>It was nearly four o&rsquo;clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over
      the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man,
      furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and
      leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising
      Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for
      us.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have ordered a carriage,&rdquo;  said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. &ldquo;I knew your
      energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It was very nice and complimentary of you,&rdquo;  Holmes answered. &ldquo;It is entirely a question of
      barometric pressure.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Lestrade looked startled. &ldquo;I do not quite follow,&rdquo;  he said.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of
      cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I
      do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Lestrade laughed indulgently. &ldquo;You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the
      newspapers,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer
      it becomes. Still, of course, one can&rsquo;t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of
      you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I
      had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen
      in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural
      reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!&rdquo;  she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a
      woman&rsquo;s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, &ldquo;I am so glad that you have come. I have driven
      down to tell you so. I know that James didn&rsquo;t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work
      knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children,
      and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to
      anyone who really knows him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,&rdquo;  said Sherlock Holmes. &ldquo;You may rely upon my doing all
      that I can.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some
      flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I think that it is very probable.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;There, now!&rdquo;  she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. &ldquo;You hear!
      He gives me hopes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his
      conclusions,&rdquo;  he said.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father,
      I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in
      it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;  asked Holmes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr.
      McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as
      brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and&#8212;and&#8212;well, he
      naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of
      them.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And your father?&rdquo;  asked Holmes. &ldquo;Was he in favour of such a union?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.&rdquo;  A quick blush passed
      over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Thank you for this information,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;May I see your father if I call
      to-morrow?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am afraid the doctor won&rsquo;t allow it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The doctor?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down
      completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is
      shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ha! In Victoria! That is important.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, at the mines.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.&rdquo; </p>
