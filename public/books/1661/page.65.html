      <p>&ldquo;I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I found myself lying upon the stone
      floor of a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held a
      candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come! come!&rsquo; she cried breathlessly. &lsquo;They will be here in a moment. They will
      see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious time, but come!&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the
      corridor and down a winding stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard the
      sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and
      from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit&rsquo;s end. Then she threw
      open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon was shining brightly.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is your only chance,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;It is high, but it may be that you can jump
      it.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage, and I saw the lean figure of
      Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher&rsquo;s cleaver in
      the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome
      the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill,
      but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me.
      If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. The thought had hardly
      flashed through my mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him and
      tried to hold him back.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fritz! Fritz!&rsquo; she cried in English, &lsquo;remember your promise after the last
      time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are mad, Elise!&rsquo; he shouted, struggling to break away from her. &lsquo;You will
      be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!&rsquo; He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the
      window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his
      blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the garden below.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as
      I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly
      dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the
      first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie
      my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among
      the rose-bushes.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been a very long time, for the moon had
      sunk, and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew, and my
      coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the
      particulars of my night&rsquo;s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be
      safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be
      seen. I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a long
      building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous
      night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have
      been an evil dream.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train. There would be one to Reading in
      less than an hour. The same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of him
      whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage the
      night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three
      miles off.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before
      telling my story to the police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound dressed,
      and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly
      what you advise.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock
      Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Here is an advertisement which will interest you,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;It appeared in all the papers
      about a year ago. Listen to this: &lsquo;Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a
      hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o&rsquo;clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was dressed
      in,&rsquo; etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I
      fancy.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo;  cried my patient. &ldquo;Then that explains what the girl said.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man, who was absolutely
      determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will leave
      no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down
      to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire
      village. There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a
      plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy
      with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo;  said he. &ldquo;That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village.
      The place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir.&rdquo; </p>
