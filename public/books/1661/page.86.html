      <p>&ldquo;I am so delighted that you have come,&rdquo;  she said earnestly. &ldquo;It is so very kind of you both;
      but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pray tell us what has happened to you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to be back before three. I got his
      leave to come into town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Let us have everything in its due order.&rdquo;  Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire
      and composed himself to listen.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and
      Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my mind
      about them.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What can you not understand?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as it occurred. When I came down, Mr.
      Rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully situated,
      but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and
      streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field
      which slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This
      ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton&rsquo;s preserves. A
      clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was introduced by him that evening to
      his wife and the child. There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in
      your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger
      than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their
      conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his
      only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that
      the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As the daughter could
      not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her
      father&rsquo;s young wife.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature. She impressed me neither
      favourably nor the reverse. She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her
      husband and to her little son. Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little
      want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole
      they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep
      thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought
      sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly
      spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite
      disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and
      gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of
      amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I
      would rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am glad of all details,&rdquo;  remarked my friend, &ldquo;whether they seem to you to be relevant or
      not.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant thing about the house, which struck
      me at once, was the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife. Toller, for
      that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice
      since I have been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it. His wife
      is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a
      most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room, which are next to
      each other in one corner of the building.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle
      came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; said he, turning to me, &lsquo;we are very much obliged to you, Miss
      Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the
      tiniest iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become you. You will find it
      laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely
      obliged.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue. It was of excellent material, a
      sort of beige, but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been a better fit if I
      had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite
      exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching
      along the entire front of the house, with three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed
      close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle,
      walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have
      ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle,
      however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a
      sad, anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence
      the duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery.</p>
