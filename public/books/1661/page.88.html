      <p>&ldquo;This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round
      to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three
      of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up
      and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my
      dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I assured him that I was not offended. &lsquo;By the way,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you seem to have quite a
      suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the shutters up.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my remark.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Photography is one of my hobbies,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I have made my dark room up there.
      But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever
      believed it?&rsquo; He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me. I read
      suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms
      which I was not to know, I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my share of
      that. It was more a feeling of duty&#8212;a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place.
      They talk of woman&rsquo;s instinct; perhaps it was woman&rsquo;s instinct which gave me that feeling. At any
      rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and
      his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with
      him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came
      upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle
      were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently
      in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at
      the farther end. Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open. They each
      led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt
      that the evening light glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it had
      been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at
      the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was not there. This barricaded door
      corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that
      the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the
      passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps
      within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out
      from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed
      me suddenly, and I turned and ran&#8212;ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of
      my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting
      outside.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So,&rsquo; said he, smiling, &lsquo;it was you, then. I thought that it must be when I saw
      the door open.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I am so frightened!&rsquo; I panted.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear young lady! my dear young lady!&rsquo;&#8212;you cannot think how caressing and
      soothing his manner was&#8212;&lsquo;and what has frightened you, my dear young lady?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was keenly on my guard against him.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;But it is so
      lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in
      there!&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Only that?&rsquo; said he, looking at me keenly.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, what did you think?&rsquo; I asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why do you think that I lock this door?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am sure that I do not know.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?&rsquo; He was still
      smiling in the most amiable manner.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am sure if I had known&#8212;&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that threshold
      again&rsquo;&#8212;here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the
      face of a demon&#8212;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll throw you to the mastiff.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my
      room. I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you, Mr.
      Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the
      woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring you down all would
      be well. Of course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind
      was soon made up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the office, which is about half
      a mile from the house, and then returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind as I
      approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of
      insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the
      savage creature, or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my
      joy at the thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning, but I
      must be back before three o&rsquo;clock, for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the
      evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be
      very glad if you could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.&rdquo; </p>
