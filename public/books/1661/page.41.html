      <p>&ldquo;No good news?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No bad?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a long day.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases, and a lucky
      chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am delighted to see you,&rdquo;  said she, pressing my hand warmly. &ldquo;You will, I am sure, forgive
      anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon
      us.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;My dear madam,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;I am an old campaigner, and if I were not I can very well see that
      no apology is needed. If I can be of any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed
      happy.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&rdquo;  said the lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon the table of
      which a cold supper had been laid out, &ldquo;I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to
      which I beg that you will give a plain answer.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Certainly, madam.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your
      real, real opinion.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Upon what point?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. &ldquo;Frankly, now!&rdquo;  she repeated, standing
      upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Frankly, then, madam, I do not.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You think that he is dead?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Murdered?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that. Perhaps.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And on what day did he meet his death?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;On Monday.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter
      from him to-day.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  he roared.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, to-day.&rdquo;  She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in the air.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;May I see it?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and
      examined it intently. I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a very coarse
      one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day before,
      for it was considerably after midnight.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Coarse writing,&rdquo;  murmured Holmes. &ldquo;Surely this is not your husband&rsquo;s writing,
      madam.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, but the enclosure is.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;How can you tell that?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself. The rest is of the greyish colour,
      which shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would
      be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before he wrote the
      address, which can only mean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so
      important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And you are sure that this is your husband&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;One of his hands.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;One?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, and yet I know it
      well.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a huge error which it may take
      some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.&#8212;NEVILLE.&rsquo; Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a
      book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap
      has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt
      that it is your husband&rsquo;s hand, madam?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;None. Neville wrote those words.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the clouds lighten, though I should not
      venture to say that the danger is over.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The ring, after all, proves nothing. It
      may have been taken from him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only posted to-day.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That is possible.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;If so, much may have happened between.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well with him. There is so keen a
      sympathy between us that I should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself
      in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something
      had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion
      of an analytical reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate
      your view. But if your husband is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very much so.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Was the window open?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then he might have called to you?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He might.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;A call for help, you thought?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes. He waved his hands.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to
      throw up his hands?&rdquo; </p>
