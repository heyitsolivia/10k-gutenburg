      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do better. I&rsquo;ll take you round to him myself.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I should be immensely obliged to you.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him. Do
      you feel equal to it?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an instant.&rdquo;  I rushed upstairs,
      explained the matter shortly to my wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new acquaintance
      to Baker Street.</p>

      <p>Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony
      column of <em>The Times</em> and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and dottles
      left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. He
      received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal. When it
      was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of
      brandy and water within his reach.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley,&rdquo;  said he.
      &ldquo;Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are
      tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;  said my patient, &ldquo;but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me, and
      I think that your breakfast has completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible,
      so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature,
      while I sat opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to
      us.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You must know,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in
      London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my work during the
      seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &amp; Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago,
      having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father&rsquo;s death, I
      determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has
      been exceptionally so. During two years I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is absolutely
      all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to <em>ï¿½</em>27 10<em>s</em>. Every day, from nine in
      the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I
      came to believe that I should never have any practice at all.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a
      gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of &lsquo;Colonel
      Lysander Stark&rsquo; engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle
      size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened
      away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this
      emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, and his
      bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than
      thirty.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Hatherley?&rsquo; said he, with something of a German accent. &lsquo;You have been
      recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet
      and capable of preserving a secret.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address. &lsquo;May I ask who it was who
      gave me so good a character?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I have it
      from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is quite correct,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;but you will excuse me if I say that I
      cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional
      matter that you wished to speak to me?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the point. I have a
      professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential&#8212;absolute secrecy, you understand,
      and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his
      family.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If I promise to keep a secret,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you may absolutely depend upon my
      doing so.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and
      questioning an eye.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you promise, then?&rsquo; said he at last.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I promise.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference to the matter at all,
      either in word or writing?&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have already given you my word.&rsquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Very good.&rsquo; He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across the room he
      flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said he, coming back. &lsquo;I know that clerks are
      sometimes curious as to their master&rsquo;s affairs. Now we can talk in safety.&rsquo; He drew up his chair very
      close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics
      of this fleshless man. Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I beg that you will state your business, sir,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;my time is of
      value.&rsquo; Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to my lips.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How would fifty guineas for a night&rsquo;s work suit you?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
