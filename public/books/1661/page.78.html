      <p>&ldquo;But what other is there?&rdquo;  cried the banker with a gesture of despair. &ldquo;If his motives were
      innocent, why does he not explain them?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is our task to find that out,&rdquo;  replied Holmes; &ldquo;so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we
      will set off for Streatham together, and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into
      details.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which I was eager enough to do, for my
      curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that the guilt of the
      banker&rsquo;s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in
      Holmes&rsquo; judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with
      the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin
      upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client appeared to have taken
      fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat
      with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest
      residence of the great financier.</p>

      <p>Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road. A double
      carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance.
      On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from
      the road to the kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen&rsquo;s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the
      stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes
      left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the front, down the tradesmen&rsquo;s
      path, and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into the
      dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened
      and a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the
      darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a
      woman&rsquo;s face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept silently
      into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was
      the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character, with immense capacity for
      self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a
      sweet womanly caress.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not, dad?&rdquo;  she asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman&rsquo;s instincts are. I know that he has done
      no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let
      the matter drop and say no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I shall never let it drop until the gems are found&#8212;never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds
      you as to the awful consequences to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London
      to inquire more deeply into it.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;This gentleman?&rdquo;  she asked, facing round to me.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the stable lane now.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The stable lane?&rdquo;  She raised her dark eyebrows. &ldquo;What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I
      suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin
      Arthur is innocent of this crime.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove it,&rdquo;  returned Holmes, going
      back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes. &ldquo;I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary
      Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You heard nothing yourself last night?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and I came down.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all the windows?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Were they all fastened this morning?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had
      been out to see him?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may have heard uncle&rsquo;s remarks
      about the coronet.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart, and that the two may have planned
      the robbery.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But what is the good of all these vague theories,&rdquo;  cried the banker impatiently, &ldquo;when I
      have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return
      by the kitchen door, I presume?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in. I saw the man,
      too, in the gloom.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis
      Prosper.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He stood,&rdquo;  said Holmes, &ldquo;to the left of the door&#8212;that is to say, farther up the path
      than is necessary to reach the door?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, he did.&rdquo; </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And he is a man with a wooden leg?&rdquo; </p>

      <p>Something like fear sprang up in the young lady&rsquo;s expressive black eyes. &ldquo;Why, you are like a
      magician,&rdquo;  said she. &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;  She smiled, but there was no answering smile in
      Holmes&rsquo; thin, eager face.</p>
