    <p>"I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced. She
    never abated the piercing quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words. They
    were always 'My husband, my father, and my brother! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
    eleven, twelve. Hush!'</p>

    <p>"This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. I had come and gone twice, and was again
    sitting by her, when she began to falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and by-and-bye
    she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.</p>

    <p>"It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and fearful storm. I released her arms, and
    called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn. It was then that I knew her
    condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen; and it was then that I
    lost the little hope I had had of her.</p>

    <p>"'Is she dead?' asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the elder brother, coming booted into the room
    from his horse.</p>

    <p>"'Not dead,' said I; 'but like to die.'</p>

    <p>"'What strength there is in these common bodies!' he said, looking down at her with some curiosity.</p>

    <p>"'There is prodigious strength,' I answered him, 'in sorrow and despair.'</p>

    <p>"He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He moved a chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the
    woman away, and said in a subdued voice,</p>

    <p>"'Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I recommended that your aid should be invited.
    Your reputation is high, and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful of your interest.
    The things that you see here, are things to be seen, and not spoken of.'</p>

    <p>"I listened to the patient's breathing, and avoided answering.</p>

    <p>"'Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?'</p>

    <p>"'Monsieur,' said I, 'in my profession, the communications of patients are always received in confidence.' I was
    guarded in my answer, for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.</p>

    <p>"Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the pulse and the heart. There was life, and no
    more. Looking round as I resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>"I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an
    underground cell and total darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or failure in my
    memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers.</p>

    <p>"She lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some few syllables that she said to me, by placing
    my ear close to her lips. She asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. It was in vain that
    I asked her for her family name. She faintly shook her head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had
    done.</p>

    <p>"I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the brothers she was sinking fast, and could
    not live another day. Until then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself,
    one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when
    it came to that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as if&mdash;the thought passed
    through my mind&mdash;I were dying too.</p>

    <p>"I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger brother's (as I call him) having crossed swords
    with a peasant, and that peasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind of either of them
    was the consideration that this was highly degrading to the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught the
    younger brother's eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply, for knowing what I knew from the
    boy. He was smoother and more polite to me than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an incumbrance in
    the mind of the elder, too.</p>

    <p>"My patient died, two hours before midnight&mdash;at a time, by my watch, answering almost to the minute when I
    had first seen her. I was alone with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and all her
    earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.</p>

    <p>"The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride away. I had heard them, alone at the bedside,
    striking their boots with their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.</p>

    <p>"'At last she is dead?' said the elder, when I went in.</p>

    <p>"'She is dead,' said I.</p>

    <p>"'I congratulate you, my brother,' were his words as he turned round.</p>

    <p>"He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking. He now gave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from
    his hand, but laid it on the table. I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept nothing.</p>

    <p>"'Pray excuse me,' said I. 'Under the circumstances, no.'</p>

    <p>"They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to them, and we parted without another word on
    either side.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>"I am weary, weary, weary&mdash;worn down by misery. I cannot read what I have written with this gaunt hand.</p>

    <p>"Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a little box, with my name on the outside. From
    the first, I had anxiously considered what I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write privately to the Minister,
    stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect,
    stating all the circumstances. I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities of the Nobles were, and I
    expected that the matter would never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the matter a
    profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever
    of my real danger; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were compromised by
    possessing the knowledge that I possessed.</p>

    <p>"I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that night. I rose long before my usual time next
    morning to finish it. It was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just completed, when I was
    told that a lady waited, who wished to see me.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>"I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so
    benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful.</p>

    <p>"The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long life. She was in great agitation. She
    presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the boy had
    addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at
    the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately.</p>
