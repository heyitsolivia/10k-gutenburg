    <p>"Now, to the prisoner's conversation, Miss Manette."</p>

    <p>"The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me&mdash;which arose out of my helpless situation&mdash;as he
    was kind, and good, and useful to my father. I hope," bursting into tears, "I may not repay him by doing him harm
    to-day."</p>

    <p>Buzzing from the blue-flies.</p>

    <p>"Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that you give the evidence which it is your duty to
    give&mdash;which you must give&mdash;and which you cannot escape from giving&mdash;with great unwillingness, he is
    the only person present in that condition. Please to go on."</p>

    <p>"He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and difficult nature, which might get people into
    trouble, and that he was therefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business had, within a few
    days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals, take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a
    long time to come."</p>

    <p>"Did he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular."</p>

    <p>"He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said that, so far as he could judge, it was a
    wrong and foolish one on England's part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George Washington might gain
    almost as great a name in history as George the Third. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said
    laughingly, and to beguile the time."</p>

    <p>Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in a scene of great interest to whom many
    eyes are directed, will be unconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her forehead was painfully anxious and intent
    as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect
    upon the counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court;
    insomuch, that a great majority of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness, when the
    Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington.</p>

    <p>Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it necessary, as a matter of precaution and form,
    to call the young lady's father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.</p>

    <p>"Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?"</p>

    <p>"Once. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or three years and a half ago."</p>

    <p>"Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or speak to his conversation with your
    daughter?"</p>

    <p>"Sir, I can do neither."</p>

    <p>"Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?"</p>

    <p>He answered, in a low voice, "There is."</p>

    <p>"Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native
    country, Doctor Manette?"</p>

    <p>He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, "A long imprisonment."</p>

    <p>"Were you newly released on the occasion in question?"</p>

    <p>"They tell me so."</p>

    <p>"Have you no remembrance of the occasion?"</p>

    <p>"None. My mind is a blank, from some time&mdash;I cannot even say what time&mdash;when I employed myself, in my
    captivity, in making shoes, to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here. She had
    become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had
    become familiar. I have no remembrance of the process."</p>

    <p>Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down together.</p>

    <p>A singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand being to show that the prisoner went down,
    with some fellow-plotter untracked, in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and got out
    of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did not remain, but from which he travelled back some
    dozen miles or more, to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness was called to identify
    him as having been at the precise time required, in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town,
    waiting for another person. The prisoner's counsel was cross-examining this witness with no result, except that he
    had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at
    the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him.
    Opening this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the
    prisoner.</p>

    <p>"You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?"</p>

    <p>The witness was quite sure.</p>

    <p>"Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?"</p>

    <p>Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.</p>

    <p>"Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there," pointing to him who had tossed the paper over, "and
    then look well upon the prisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?"</p>

    <p>Allowing for my learned friend's appearance being careless and slovenly if not debauched, they were sufficiently
    like each other to surprise, not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought into
    comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside his wig, and giving no very gracious consent,
    the likeness became much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver (the prisoner's counsel), whether they
    were next to try Mr. Carton (name of my learned friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he
    would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might happen twice; whether he would have been so
    confident if he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so confident, having seen it;
    and more. The upshot of which, was, to smash this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to
    useless lumber.</p>
