    <p>Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking off her darling's bonnet when she came
    up-stairs, and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and folding her mantle
    ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair
    if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant sight too, embracing her and
    thanking her, and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her&mdash;which last she only dared to do
    playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant
    sight too, looking on at them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with eyes that had as
    much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight
    too, beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining
    years to a Home. But, no Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment
    of Miss Pross's prediction.</p>

    <p>Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of the little household, Miss Pross took charge
    of the lower regions, and always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest quality, were so well
    cooked and so well served, and so neat in their contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be
    better. Miss Pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent
    provinces, in search of impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would impart culinary
    mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the
    woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress, or Cinderella's Godmother: who
    would send out for a fowl, a rabbit, a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she
    pleased.</p>

    <p>On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown
    periods, either in the lower regions, or in her own room on the second floor&mdash;a blue chamber, to which no one
    but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion, Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and
    pleasant efforts to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.</p>

    <p>It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the
    plane-tree, and they should sit there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her, they went
    out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed
    herself, some time before, as Mr. Lorry's cup-bearer; and while they sat under the plane-tree, talking, she kept his
    glass replenished. Mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree whispered
    to them in its own way above their heads.</p>

    <p>Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay presented himself while they were sitting
    under the plane-tree, but he was only One.</p>

    <p>Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching
    in the head and body, and retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder, and she
    called it, in familiar conversation, "a fit of the jerks."</p>

    <p>The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The resemblance between him and Lucie was very
    strong at such times, and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting his arm on the back
    of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the likeness.</p>

    <p>He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual vivacity. "Pray, Doctor Manette," said Mr.
    Darnay, as they sat under the plane-tree&mdash;and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand, which
    happened to be the old buildings of London&mdash;"have you seen much of the Tower?"</p>

    <p>"Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of it, to know that it teems with interest;
    little more."</p>

    <p>"<em>I</em> have been there, as you remember," said Darnay, with a smile, though reddening a little angrily, "in
    another character, and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a curious thing
    when I was there."</p>

    <p>"What was that?" Lucie asked.</p>

    <p>"In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and
    forgotten. Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners&mdash;dates,
    names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone
    to execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly,
    with an unsteady hand. At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully examined, the last letter
    was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses
    were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested that the letters were not initials, but the
    complete word, DIG. The floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the earth beneath a stone,
    or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern
    case or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he had written something, and hidden it
    away to keep it from the gaoler."</p>

    <p>"My father," exclaimed Lucie, "you are ill!"</p>

    <p>He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and his look quite terrified them all.</p>

    <p>"No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they made me start. We had better go in."</p>

    <p>He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large drops, and he showed the back of his hand
    with rain-drops on it. But, he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of, and, as
    they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it
    turned towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the
    passages of the Court House.</p>

    <p>He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of his business eye. The arm of the golden
    giant in the hall was not more steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet
    proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and that the rain had startled him.</p>
