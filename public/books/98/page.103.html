    <p>"Yes!"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil, yesterday. When is it dated? But no
    matter; don't stay to look; put it up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until within
    this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled,
    and, I have reason to think, will be."</p>

    <p>"They are not in danger?"</p>

    <p>"They are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by Madame Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I
    have overheard words of that woman's, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong colours. I have
    lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison
    wall, is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by Madame Defarge as to his having seen
    Her"&mdash;he never mentioned Lucie's name&mdash;"making signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee that
    the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will involve her life&mdash;and perhaps her
    child's&mdash;and perhaps her father's&mdash;for both have been seen with her at that place. Don't look so
    horrified. You will save them all."</p>

    <p>"Heaven grant I may, Carton! But how?"</p>

    <p>"I am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could depend on no better man. This new denunciation
    will certainly not take place until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards; more probably
    a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She
    and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot
    be described) would wait to add that strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure. You follow me?"</p>

    <p>"So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for the moment I lose sight," touching the
    back of the Doctor's chair, "even of this distress."</p>

    <p>"You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast as quickly as the journey can be made. Your
    preparations have been completed for some days, to return to England. Early to-morrow have your horses ready, so
    that they may be in starting trim at two o'clock in the afternoon."</p>

    <p>"It shall be done!"</p>

    <p>His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the flame, and was as quick as youth.</p>

    <p>"You are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better man? Tell her, to-night, what you know of her
    danger as involving her child and her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head beside her
    husband's cheerfully." He faltered for an instant; then went on as before. "For the sake of her child and her
    father, press upon her the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour. Tell her that it was her
    husband's last arrangement. Tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. You think that her
    father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?"</p>

    <p>"I am sure of it."</p>

    <p>"I thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the courtyard here, even to the taking of
    your own seat in the carriage. The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away."</p>

    <p>"I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?"</p>

    <p>"You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will reserve my place. Wait for nothing but to
    have my place occupied, and then for England!"</p>

    <p>"Why, then," said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand, "it does not all depend on one old
    man, but I shall have a young and ardent man at my side."</p>

    <p>"By the help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on
    which we now stand pledged to one another."</p>

    <p>"Nothing, Carton."</p>

    <p>"Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it&mdash;for any reason&mdash;and no life can
    possibly be saved, and many lives must inevitably be sacrificed."</p>

    <p>"I will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully."</p>

    <p>"And I hope to do mine. Now, good bye!"</p>

    <p>Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even put the old man's hand to his lips, he
    did not part from him then. He helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers, as to get a
    cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still
    moaningly besought to have. He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where
    the afflicted heart&mdash;so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to
    it&mdash;outwatched the awful night. He entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone, looking up
    at the light in the window of her room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a Farewell.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">XIII. Fifty-two</h2>
    <p>In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited their fate. They were in number as the
    weeks of the year. Fifty-two were to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless everlasting
    sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood
    spilled yesterday, the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set apart.</p>

    <p>Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy, whose riches could not buy his life, to
    the seamstress of twenty, whose poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered in the vices
    and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees; and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable
    suffering, intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally without distinction.</p>

    <p>Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the
    Tribunal. In every line of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had fully comprehended that
    no personal influence could possibly save him, that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could
    avail him nothing.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him, to compose his mind to what it
    must bear. His hold on life was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts and degrees
    unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it
    yielded, this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts, a turbulent and heated working of his
    heart, that contended against resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and child who had
    to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing.</p>
