    <p>At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and proceeded to offer it to him. The lion
    took it with care and caution, made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal assisted both.
    When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The
    jackal then invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application to his head, and applied
    himself to the collection of a second meal; this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not
    disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.</p>

    <p>"And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch," said Mr. Stryver.</p>

    <p>The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and
    complied.</p>

    <p>"You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses to-day. Every question told."</p>

    <p>"I always am sound; am I not?"</p>

    <p>"I don't gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to it and smooth it again."</p>

    <p>With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.</p>

    <p>"The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School," said Stryver, nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in
    the present and the past, "the old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and now in
    despondency!"</p>

    <p>"Ah!" returned the other, sighing: "yes! The same Sydney, with the same luck. Even then, I did exercises for
    other boys, and seldom did my own."</p>

    <p>"And why not?"</p>

    <p>"God knows. It was my way, I suppose."</p>

    <p>He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him, looking at the fire.</p>

    <p>"Carton," said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air, as if the fire-grate had been the furnace
    in which sustained endeavour was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney Carton of old
    Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, "your way is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and
    purpose. Look at me."</p>

    <p>"Oh, botheration!" returned Sydney, with a lighter and more good-humoured laugh, "don't <em>you</em> be
    moral!"</p>

    <p>"How have I done what I have done?" said Stryver; "how do I do what I do?"</p>

    <p>"Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it's not worth your while to apostrophise me, or the air,
    about it; what you want to do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind."</p>

    <p>"I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?"</p>

    <p>"I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were," said Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they
    both laughed.</p>

    <p>"Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury," pursued Carton, "you have fallen into your
    rank, and I have fallen into mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris, picking up
    French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I
    was always nowhere."</p>

    <p>"And whose fault was that?"</p>

    <p>"Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always driving and riving and shouldering and
    passing, to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It's a gloomy thing,
    however, to talk about one's own past, with the day breaking. Turn me in some other direction before I go."</p>

    <p>"Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness," said Stryver, holding up his glass. "Are you turned in a pleasant
    direction?"</p>

    <p>Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.</p>

    <p>"Pretty witness," he muttered, looking down into his glass. "I have had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night;
    who's your pretty witness?"</p>

    <p>"The picturesque doctor's daughter, Miss Manette."</p>

    <p>"<em>She</em> pretty?"</p>

    <p>"Is she not?"</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>"Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!"</p>

    <p>"Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty? She was a golden-haired
    doll!"</p>

    <p>"Do you know, Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his
    florid face: "do you know, I rather thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll, and were
    quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?"</p>

    <p>"Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a yard or two of a man's nose, he can see
    it without a perspective-glass. I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I'll have no more drink; I'll get to
    bed."</p>

    <p>When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light him down the stairs, the day was coldly
    looking in through its grimy windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the dull sky overcast,
    the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
    before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and the first spray of it in its advance had
    begun to overwhelm the city.</p>

    <p>Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace, and
    saw for a moment, lying in the wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and
    perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon
    him, gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight. A moment, and it
    was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed,
    and its pillow was wet with wasted tears.</p>

    <p>Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions,
    incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on
    him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">VI. Hundreds of People</h2>
    <p>The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of
    a certain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried it, as to the
    public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where
    he lived, on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become
    the Doctor's friend, and the quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.</p>

    <p>On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in the afternoon, for three reasons of habit.
    Firstly, because, on fine Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie; secondly, because,
    on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of
    window, and generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to
    solve, and knew how the ways of the Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them.</p>
