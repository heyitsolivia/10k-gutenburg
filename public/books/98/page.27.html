    <p>A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be found in London. There was no way through
    it, and the front windows of the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial
    air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then, north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and
    wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a consequence, country airs circulated
    in Soho with vigorous freedom, instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement; and
    there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which the peaches ripened in their season.</p>

    <p>The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day; but, when the streets grew
    hot, the corner was in shadow, though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of
    brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging
    streets.</p>

    <p>There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a
    large stiff house, where several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was audible any day,
    and which was shunned by all of them at night. In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a
    plane-tree rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver to be chased, and likewise gold to
    be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall&mdash;as if he
    had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a
    lonely lodger rumoured to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have a counting-house below,
    was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered
    about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a thump from the golden giant. These, however,
    were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the house, and the
    echoes in the corner before it, had their own way from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.</p>

    <p>Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and its revival in the floating whispers of his
    story, brought him. His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments,
    brought him otherwise into moderate request, and he earned as much as he wanted.</p>

    <p>These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts, and notice, when he rang the door-bell of the
    tranquil house in the corner, on the fine Sunday afternoon.</p>

    <p>"Doctor Manette at home?"</p>

    <p>Expected home.</p>

    <p>"Miss Lucie at home?"</p>

    <p>Expected home.</p>

    <p>"Miss Pross at home?"</p>

    <p>Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to
    admission or denial of the fact.</p>

    <p>"As I am at home myself," said Mr. Lorry, "I'll go upstairs."</p>

    <p>Although the Doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth, she appeared to have innately
    derived from it that ability to make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most agreeable
    characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off by so many little adornments, of no value but for their
    taste and fancy, that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the rooms, from the largest object
    to the least; the arrangement of colours, the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by
    delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so expressive of their
    originator, that, as Mr. Lorry stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him, with something
    of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time, whether he approved?</p>

    <p>There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might
    pass freely through them all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all
    around him, walked from one to another. The first was the best room, and in it were Lucie's birds, and flowers, and
    books, and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was the Doctor's consulting-room, used also as
    the dining-room; the third, changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the Doctor's
    bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker's bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the
    fifth floor of the dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.</p>

    <p>"I wonder," said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, "that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about
    him!"</p>

    <p>"And why wonder at that?" was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.</p>

    <p>It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose acquaintance he had first made at the
    Royal George Hotel at Dover, and had since improved.</p>

    <p>"I should have thought&mdash;" Mr. Lorry began.</p>

    <p>"Pooh! You'd have thought!" said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.</p>

    <p>"How do you do?" inquired that lady then&mdash;sharply, and yet as if to express that she bore him no
    malice.</p>

    <p>"I am pretty well, I thank you," answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; "how are you?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing to boast of," said Miss Pross.</p>

    <p>"Indeed?"</p>

    <p>"Ah! indeed!" said Miss Pross. "I am very much put out about my Ladybird."</p>

    <p>"Indeed?"</p>

    <p>"For gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed,' or you'll fidget me to death," said Miss Pross: whose
    character (dissociated from stature) was shortness.</p>

    <p>"Really, then?" said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.</p>

    <p>"Really, is bad enough," returned Miss Pross, "but better. Yes, I am very much put out."</p>

    <p>"May I ask the cause?"</p>

    <p>"I don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to come here looking after her," said Miss
    Pross.</p>

    <p>"<em>Do</em> dozens come for that purpose?"</p>

    <p>"Hundreds," said Miss Pross.</p>

    <p>It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her time and since) that whenever her original
    proposition was questioned, she exaggerated it.</p>

    <p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.</p>

    <p>"I have lived with the darling&mdash;or the darling has lived with me, and paid me for it; which she certainly
    should never have done, you may take your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her for
    nothing&mdash;since she was ten years old. And it's really very hard," said Miss Pross.</p>

    <p>Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head; using that important part of himself as a
    sort of fairy cloak that would fit anything.</p>
