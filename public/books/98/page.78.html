    <p>The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the key; then, came hurrying back to the
    Doctor, and opened the window and partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor's arm, and looked out
    with him into the courtyard.</p>

    <p>Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near enough, to fill the courtyard: not more
    than forty or fifty in all. The people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they had rushed
    in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired
    spot.</p>

    <p>But, such awful workers, and such awful work!</p>

    <p>The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two men, whose faces, as their long hair
    flapped back when the whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than the
    visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise. False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon
    them, and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with howling, and all staring and
    glaring with beastly excitement and want of sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung
    forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women held wine to their mouths that they might
    drink; and what with dropping blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks struck out of
    the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free
    from the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the
    waist, with the stain all over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain upon those rags; men
    devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through and
    through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked
    swords were tied to the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments of dress: ligatures
    various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the
    stream of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes;&mdash;eyes which
    any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.</p>

    <p>All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of any human creature at any very great pass,
    could see a world if it were there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for explanation in his
    friend's ashy face.</p>

    <p>"They are," Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at the locked room, "murdering the prisoners.
    If you are sure of what you say; if you really have the power you think you have&mdash;as I believe you
    have&mdash;make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. It may be too late, I don't know, but let
    it not be a minute later!"</p>

    <p>Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room, and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry
    regained the blind.</p>

    <p>His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons
    aside like water, carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone. For a few moments there was
    a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him,
    surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to
    shoulder, hurried out with cries of&mdash;"Live the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner's kindred in
    La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!" and a thousand
    answering shouts.</p>

    <p>He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and
    told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found her child and Miss
    Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when
    he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew.</p>

    <p>Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet, clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid
    the child down on his own bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge. O the long,
    long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And O the long, long night, with no return of her father and no
    tidings!</p>

    <p>Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the irruption was repeated, and the grindstone
    whirled and spluttered. "What is it?" cried Lucie, affrighted. "Hush! The soldiers' swords are sharpened there,"
    said Mr. Lorry. "The place is national property now, and used as a kind of armoury, my love."</p>

    <p>Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful. Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and
    he softly detached himself from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so besmeared that he
    might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the
    pavement by the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air. Shortly, this worn-out murderer
    descried in the imperfect light one of the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,
    climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty cushions.</p>

    <p>The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again, and the sun was red on the courtyard.
    But, the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had never
    given, and would never take away.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">III. The Shadow</h2>
    <p>One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr. Lorry when business hours came round, was
    this:&mdash;that he had no right to imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the Bank
    roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded for Lucie and her child, without a moment's demur;
    but the great trust he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business.</p>

    <p>At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with
    its master in reference to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the same
    consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the most violent Quarter, and doubtless was
    influential there, and deep in its dangerous workings.</p>
