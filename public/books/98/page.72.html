    <p>"For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur
    heretofore the Marquis, to succour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh Monsieur heretofore
    the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!</p>

    <p>"From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur
    heretofore the Marquis, the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.</p>

    <p>"Your afflicted,</p>

    <p>"Gabelle."</p>

    <p>The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter. The peril of an old servant
    and a good one, whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so reproachfully in the face,
    that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.</p>

    <p>He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the
    old family house, in his resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded
    the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold, he had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love
    for Lucie, his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own mind, had been hurried and
    incomplete. He knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to
    do it, and that it had never been done.</p>

    <p>The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being always actively employed, the swift changes
    and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week annihilated the
    immature plans of last week, and the events of the week following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the
    force of these circumstances he had yielded:&mdash;not without disquiet, but still without continuous and
    accumulating resistance. That he had watched the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled
    until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from France by every highway and byway, and their
    property was in course of confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out, was as well known to
    himself as it could be to any new authority in France that might impeach him for it.</p>

    <p>But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his
    dues, that he had relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no favour in it, won his own
    private place there, and earned his own bread. Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on
    written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little there was to give&mdash;such fuel as the heavy
    creditors would let them have in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the
    summer&mdash;and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his own safety, so that it could not but appear
    now.</p>

    <p>This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make, that he would go to Paris.</p>

    <p>Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the
    Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind drifted him
    on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad
    aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who could not fail to know that
    he was better than they, was not there, trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy and
    humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison
    of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison (injurious to himself) had
    instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur, which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all
    were coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle's letter: the appeal of an innocent
    prisoner, in danger of death, to his justice, honour, and good name.</p>

    <p>His resolution was made. He must go to Paris.</p>

    <p>Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly
    any danger. The intention with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left it incomplete,
    presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to
    assert it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds,
    arose before him, and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution that
    was running so fearfully wild.</p>

    <p>As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that neither Lucie nor her father must know of it
    until he was gone. Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always reluctant to turn his
    thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old, should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in
    the balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father,
    through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not discuss with
    himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence in his course.</p>

    <p>He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr.
    Lorry. As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say nothing of his
    intention now.</p>

    <p>A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was booted and equipped.</p>

    <p>"I have delivered that letter," said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. "I would not consent to your being charged with
    any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?"</p>

    <p>"That I will, and readily," said Mr. Lorry, "if it is not dangerous."</p>

    <p>"Not at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye."</p>

    <p>"What is his name?" said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his hand.</p>

    <p>"Gabelle."</p>

    <p>"Gabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?"</p>

    <p>"Simply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come.'"</p>

    <p>"Any time mentioned?"</p>

    <p>"He will start upon his journey to-morrow night."</p>

    <p>"Any person mentioned?"</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks, and went out with him from the warm
    atmosphere of the old Bank, into the misty air of Fleet-street. "My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie," said Mr.
    Lorry at parting, "and take precious care of them till I come back." Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully
    smiled, as the carriage rolled away.</p>
