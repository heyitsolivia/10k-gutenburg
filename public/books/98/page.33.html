    <p>"Hold!" said Monsieur the Marquis. "Hold the horses! Who threw that?"</p>

    <p>He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a moment before; but the wretched father was
    grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark
    stout woman, knitting.</p>

    <p>"You dogs!" said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front, except as to the spots on his nose: "I
    would ride over any of you very willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal threw at the
    carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he should be crushed under the wheels."</p>

    <p>So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them, within
    the law and beyond it, that not a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one. But the woman
    who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it;
    his contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he leaned back in his seat again, and gave
    the word "Go on!"</p>

    <p>He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession; the Minister, the State-Projector,
    the Farmer-General, the Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the whole Fancy Ball in a
    bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained
    looking on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle, and making a barrier behind
    which they slunk, and through which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself away
    with it, when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the
    running of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball&mdash;when the one woman who had stood conspicuous, knitting,
    still knitted on with the steadfastness of Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran
    into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule, time and tide waited for no man, the rats
    were sleeping close together in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all things ran
    their course.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">VIII. Monseigneur in the Country</h2>
    <p>A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant. Patches of poor rye where corn should have
    been, patches of poor peas and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On inanimate nature,
    as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating
    unwillingly&mdash;a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away.</p>

    <p>Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been lighter), conducted by four post-horses
    and two postilions, fagged up a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of
    his high breeding; it was not from within; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his
    control&mdash;the setting sun.</p>

    <p>The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill-top, that its occupant was
    steeped in crimson. "It will die out," said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, "directly."</p>

    <p>In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel,
    and the carriage slid down hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed quickly; the sun
    and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow left when the drag was taken off.</p>

    <p>But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep
    and rise beyond it, a church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a fortress on it used as a
    prison. Round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was
    coming near home.</p>

    <p>The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for
    relays of post-horses, poor fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All its people were
    poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors, shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were
    at the fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten.
    Expressive signs of what made them poor, were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax
    for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid there, according to solemn inscription
    in the little village, until the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.</p>

    <p>Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women, their choice on earth was stated in the
    prospect&mdash;Life on the lowest terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill; or
    captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.</p>

    <p>Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions' whips, which twined snake-like about
    their heads in the evening air, as if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in his travelling
    carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look
    at him. He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and
    figure, that was to make the meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through
    the best part of a hundred years.</p>

    <p>Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him, as the like of himself had
    drooped before Monseigneur of the Court&mdash;only the difference was, that these faces drooped merely to suffer and
    not to propitiate&mdash;when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group.</p>

    <p>"Bring me hither that fellow!" said the Marquis to the courier.</p>

    <p>The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round to look and listen, in the manner of the
    people at the Paris fountain.</p>

    <p>"I passed you on the road?"</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the road."</p>

    <p>"Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?"</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur, it is true."</p>

    <p>"What did you look at, so fixedly?"</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur, I looked at the man."</p>

    <p>He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage. All his fellows stooped to look
    under the carriage.</p>

    <p>"What man, pig? And why look there?"</p>
