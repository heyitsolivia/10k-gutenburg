    <p>The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young
    lady, who were seated in a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing dominoes, three standing
    by the counter lengthening out a short supply of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the
    elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, "This is our man."</p>

    <p>"What the devil do <em>you</em> do in that galley there?" said Monsieur Defarge to himself; "I don't know
    you."</p>

    <p>But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who
    were drinking at the counter.</p>

    <p>"How goes it, Jacques?" said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. "Is all the spilt wine swallowed?"</p>

    <p>"Every drop, Jacques," answered Monsieur Defarge.</p>

    <p>When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge, picking her teeth with her toothpick,
    coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.</p>

    <p>"It is not often," said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur Defarge, "that many of these miserable
    beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?"</p>

    <p>"It is so, Jacques," Monsieur Defarge returned.</p>

    <p>At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still using her toothpick with profound
    composure, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.</p>

    <p>The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips.</p>

    <p>"Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths, and hard lives
    they live, Jacques. Am I right, Jacques?"</p>

    <p>"You are right, Jacques," was the response of Monsieur Defarge.</p>

    <p>This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick
    by, kept her eyebrows up, and slightly rustled in her seat.</p>

    <p>"Hold then! True!" muttered her husband. "Gentlemen&mdash;my wife!"</p>

    <p>The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three flourishes. She acknowledged their homage
    by bending her head, and giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop, took up
    her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit, and became absorbed in it.</p>

    <p>"Gentlemen," said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her, "good day. The chamber,
    furnished bachelor-fashion, that you wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the fifth
    floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here," pointing with his hand,
    "near to the window of my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been there, and can show
    the way. Gentlemen, adieu!"</p>

    <p>They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting
    when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.</p>

    <p>"Willingly, sir," said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to the door.</p>

    <p>Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first word, Monsieur Defarge started and became
    deeply attentive. It had not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then beckoned to the young
    lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.</p>

    <p>Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus, joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to
    which he had directed his own company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard, and was the
    general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved
    entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master, and
    put her hand to his lips. It was a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable transformation had
    come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a
    secret, angry, dangerous man.</p>

    <p>"It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly." Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to
    Mr. Lorry, as they began ascending the stairs.</p>

    <p>"Is he alone?" the latter whispered.</p>

    <p>"Alone! God help him, who should be with him!" said the other, in the same low voice.</p>

    <p>"Is he always alone, then?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"Of his own desire?"</p>

    <p>"Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they found me and demanded to know if I would take
    him, and, at my peril be discreet&mdash;as he was then, so he is now."</p>

    <p>"He is greatly changed?"</p>

    <p>"Changed!"</p>

    <p>The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand, and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct
    answer could have been half so forcible. Mr. Lorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his two companions
    ascended higher and higher.</p>

    <p>Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded parts of Paris, would be bad enough now;
    but, at that time, it was vile indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation within the
    great foul nest of one high building&mdash;that is to say, the room or rooms within every door that opened on the
    general staircase&mdash;left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides flinging other refuse from its own
    windows. The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted the air, even if
    poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it
    almost insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay. Yielding to
    his own disturbance of mind, and to his young companion's agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr. Jarvis
    Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good
    airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in. Through the
    rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range,
    nearer or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any promise on it of healthy life or
    wholesome aspirations.</p>

    <p>At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the third time. There was yet an upper
    staircase, of a steeper inclination and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story was
    reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry
    took, as though he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about here, and, carefully
    feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over his shoulder, took out a key.</p>
