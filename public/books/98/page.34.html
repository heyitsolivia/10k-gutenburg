    <p>"Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe&mdash;the drag."</p>

    <p>"Who?" demanded the traveller.</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur, the man."</p>

    <p>"May the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man? You know all the men of this part of the
    country. Who was he?"</p>

    <p>"Your clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of all the days of my life, I never saw
    him."</p>

    <p>"Swinging by the chain? To be suffocated?"</p>

    <p>"With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur. His head hanging over&mdash;like
    this!"</p>

    <p>He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his face thrown up to the sky, and his head
    hanging down; then recovered himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.</p>

    <p>"What was he like?"</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!"</p>

    <p>The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all eyes, without comparing notes with other
    eyes, looked at Monsieur the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience.</p>

    <p>"Truly, you did well," said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him, "to see a
    thief accompanying my carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur Gabelle!"</p>

    <p>Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary united; he had come out with great
    obsequiousness to assist at this examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official
    manner.</p>

    <p>"Bah! Go aside!" said Monsieur Gabelle.</p>

    <p>"Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to-night, and be sure that his business is
    honest, Gabelle."</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders."</p>

    <p>"Did he run away, fellow?&mdash;where is that Accursed?"</p>

    <p>The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends, pointing out the chain with
    his blue cap. Some half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and presented him breathless to
    Monsieur the Marquis.</p>

    <p>"Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?"</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as a person plunges into the river."</p>

    <p>"See to it, Gabelle. Go on!"</p>

    <p>The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so
    suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or they might not
    have been so fortunate.</p>

    <p>The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond, was soon checked by the
    steepness of the hill. Gradually, it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet
    scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies,
    quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the courier was audible,
    trotting on ahead into the dull distance.</p>

    <p>At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground, with a Cross and a new large figure of Our
    Saviour on it; it was a poor figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had studied the figure
    from the life&mdash;his own life, maybe&mdash;for it was dreadfully spare and thin.</p>

    <p>To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse, and was not at its worst, a
    woman was kneeling. She turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and presented herself at the
    carriage-door.</p>

    <p>"It is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition."</p>

    <p>With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face, Monseigneur looked out.</p>

    <p>"How, then! What is it? Always petitions!"</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester."</p>

    <p>"What of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you people. He cannot pay something?"</p>

    <p>"He has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead."</p>

    <p>"Well! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?"</p>

    <p>"Alas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor grass."</p>

    <p>"Well?"</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?"</p>

    <p>"Again, well?"</p>

    <p>She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one of passionate grief; by turns she clasped her veinous
    and knotted hands together with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door&mdash;tenderly, caressingly,
    as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to feel the appealing touch.</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of want; so many die of want; so many more
    will die of want."</p>

    <p>"Again, well? Can I feed them?"</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don't ask it. My petition is, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my
    husband's name, may be placed over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be quickly forgotten, it
    will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass.
    Monseigneur, they are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want. Monseigneur! Monseigneur!"</p>

    <p>The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened
    the pace, she was left far behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly diminishing the league
    or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau.</p>

    <p>The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose, as the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty,
    ragged, and toil-worn group at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid of the blue cap
    without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees,
    as they could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled in little casements; which lights, as
    the casements darkened, and more stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been
    extinguished.</p>

    <p>The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees, was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that
    time; and the shadow was exchanged for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door of his
    chateau was opened to him.</p>

    <p>"Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?"</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur, not yet."</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">IX. The Gorgon's Head</h2>
    <p>It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, with a large stone courtyard before it,
    and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony business altogether,
    with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions,
    in all directions. As if the Gorgon's head had surveyed it, when it was finished, two centuries ago.</p>
