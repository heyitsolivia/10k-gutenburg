    <p>Mr. Cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were but two in number, even if a closet with
    a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as it was, on the
    windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers
    arranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth was spread.</p>

    <p>Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin at home. At first, he slept heavily, but, by
    degrees, began to roll and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair looking as if it must
    tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture, he exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:</p>

    <p>"Bust me, if she ain't at it agin!"</p>

    <p>A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a corner, with sufficient haste and
    trepidation to show that she was the person referred to.</p>

    <p>"What!" said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. "You're at it agin, are you?"</p>

    <p>After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at the woman as a third. It was a very muddy
    boot, and may introduce the odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher's domestic economy, that, whereas he often
    came home after banking hours with clean boots, he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with
    clay.</p>

    <p>"What," said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his mark&mdash;"what are you up to,
    Aggerawayter?"</p>

    <p>"I was only saying my prayers."</p>

    <p>"Saying your prayers! You're a nice woman! What do you mean by flopping yourself down and praying agin me?"</p>

    <p>"I was not praying against you; I was praying for you."</p>

    <p>"You weren't. And if you were, I won't be took the liberty with. Here! your mother's a nice woman, young Jerry,
    going a praying agin your father's prosperity. You've got a dutiful mother, you have, my son. You've got a religious
    mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out
    of the mouth of her only child."</p>

    <p>Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning to his mother, strongly deprecated any
    praying away of his personal board.</p>

    <p>"And what do you suppose, you conceited female," said Mr. Cruncher, with unconscious inconsistency, "that the
    worth of <em>your</em> prayers may be? Name the price that you put <em>your</em> prayers at!"</p>

    <p>"They only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more than that."</p>

    <p>"Worth no more than that," repeated Mr. Cruncher. "They ain't worth much, then. Whether or no, I won't be prayed
    agin, I tell you. I can't afford it. I'm not a going to be made unlucky by <em>your</em> sneaking. If you must go
    flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and child, and not in opposition to 'em. If I had had any but
    a unnat'ral wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat'ral mother, I might have made some money last week
    instead of being counter-prayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck. B-u-u-ust me!"
    said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting on his clothes, "if I ain't, what with piety and one blowed
    thing and another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with!
    Young Jerry, dress yourself, my boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then, and if you
    see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I tell you," here he addressed his wife once more, "I won't be
    gone agin, in this manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I'm as sleepy as laudanum, my lines is strained to
    that degree that I shouldn't know, if it wasn't for the pain in 'em, which was me and which somebody else, yet I'm
    none the better for it in pocket; and it's my suspicion that you've been at it from morning to night to prevent me
    from being the better for it in pocket, and I won't put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you say now!"</p>

    <p>Growling, in addition, such phrases as "Ah! yes! You're religious, too. You wouldn't put yourself in opposition
    to the interests of your husband and child, would you? Not you!" and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the
    whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation
    for business. In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes, and whose young eyes stood
    close by one another, as his father's did, kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly disturbed that poor
    woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made his toilet, with a suppressed cry of "You
    are going to flop, mother. &mdash;Halloa, father!" and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in again with
    an undutiful grin.</p>

    <p>Mr. Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher's saying
    grace with particular animosity.</p>

    <p>"Now, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?"</p>

    <p>His wife explained that she had merely "asked a blessing."</p>

    <p>"Don't do it!" said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the
    efficacy of his wife's petitions. "I ain't a going to be blest out of house and home. I won't have my wittles blest
    off my table. Keep still!"</p>

    <p>Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial
    turn, Jerry Cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed inmate of a
    menagerie. Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an
    exterior as he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation of the day.</p>

    <p>It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite description of himself as "a honest tradesman."
    His stock consisted of a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool, young Jerry, walking
    at his father's side, carried every morning to beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where,
    with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and
    wet from the odd-job-man's feet, it formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr. Cruncher was as well
    known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar itself,&mdash;and was almost as in-looking.</p>

    <p>Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they
    passed in to Tellson's, Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry standing by him,
    when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on
    passing boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son, extremely like each other, looking
    silently on at the morning traffic in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes of
    each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys. The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental
    circumstance, that the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the youthful Jerry were as
    restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in Fleet-street.</p>
