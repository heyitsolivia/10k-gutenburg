    <p>"All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet, are always turning up," said Miss Pross.
    "When you began it&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"<em>I</em> began it, Miss Pross?"</p>

    <p>"Didn't you? Who brought her father to life?"</p>

    <p>"Oh! If <em>that</em> was beginning it&mdash;" said Mr. Lorry.</p>

    <p>"It wasn't ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard enough; not that I have any fault to find
    with Doctor Manette, except that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on him, for it was not
    to be expected that anybody should be, under any circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have
    crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven him), to take Ladybird's affections away
    from me."</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by this time to be, beneath the service of her
    eccentricity, one of those unselfish creatures&mdash;found only among women&mdash;who will, for pure love and
    admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost it, to beauty that they never had, to
    accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon their own
    sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of
    the heart; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted respect for it, that in the
    retributive arrangements made by his own mind&mdash;we all make such arrangements, more or less&mdash;he stationed
    Miss Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by Nature and Art, who
    had balances at Tellson's.</p>

    <p>"There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird," said Miss Pross; "and that was my brother
    Solomon, if he hadn't made a mistake in life."</p>

    <p>Here again: Mr. Lorry's inquiries into Miss Pross's personal history had established the fact that her brother
    Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to speculate with,
    and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with no touch of compunction. Miss Pross's fidelity of belief in
    Solomon (deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its
    weight in his good opinion of her.</p>

    <p>"As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of business," he said, when they had got back to
    the drawing-room and had sat down there in friendly relations, "let me ask you&mdash;does the Doctor, in talking
    with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?"</p>

    <p>"Never."</p>

    <p>"And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?"</p>

    <p>"Ah!" returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. "But I don't say he don't refer to it within himself."</p>

    <p>"Do you believe that he thinks of it much?"</p>

    <p>"I do," said Miss Pross.</p>

    <p>"Do you imagine&mdash;" Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up short with:</p>

    <p>"Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all."</p>

    <p>"I stand corrected; do you suppose&mdash;you go so far as to suppose, sometimes?"</p>

    <p>"Now and then," said Miss Pross.</p>

    <p>"Do you suppose," Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, "that
    Doctor Manette has any theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to the cause of his being so
    oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his oppressor?"</p>

    <p>"I don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me."</p>

    <p>"And that is&mdash;?"</p>

    <p>"That she thinks he has."</p>

    <p>"Now don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a mere dull man of business, and you are a
    woman of business."</p>

    <p>"Dull?" Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.</p>

    <p>Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, "No, no, no. Surely not. To return to
    business:&mdash;Is it not remarkable that Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well
    assured he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me, though he had business relations with
    me many years ago, and we are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached,
    and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss Pross, I don't approach the topic with you, out of
    curiosity, but out of zealous interest."</p>

    <p>"Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad's the best, you'll tell me," said Miss Pross, softened by the
    tone of the apology, "he is afraid of the whole subject."</p>

    <p>"Afraid?"</p>

    <p>"It's plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It's a dreadful remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself
    grew out of it. Not knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never feel certain of not
    losing himself again. That alone wouldn't make the subject pleasant, I should think."</p>

    <p>It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. "True," said he, "and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a
    doubt lurks in my mind, Miss Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up
    within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present
    confidence."</p>

    <p>"Can't be helped," said Miss Pross, shaking her head. "Touch that string, and he instantly changes for the worse.
    Better leave it alone. In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in the dead of the
    night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has
    learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in his old prison. She hurries to
    him, and they go on together, walking up and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says a
    word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it best not to hint at it to him. In silence they
    go walking up and down together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have brought him to
    himself."</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding Miss Pross's denial of her own imagination, there was a perception of the pain of being
    monotonously haunted by one sad idea, in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to her
    possessing such a thing.</p>

    <p>The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread
    of coming feet, that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going.</p>

    <p>"Here they are!" said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference; "and now we shall have hundreds of people
    pretty soon!"</p>

    <p>It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry
    stood at the open window, looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied they would never
    approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never
    came would be heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand. However, father and
    daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them.</p>
