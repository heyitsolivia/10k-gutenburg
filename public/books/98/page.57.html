    <h2 class="chapter-break">XVIII. Nine Days</h2>
    <p>The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctor's room, where he
    was speaking with Charles Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr. Lorry, and Miss
    Pross&mdash;to whom the event, through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of
    absolute bliss, but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have been the
    bridegroom.</p>

    <p>"And so," said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride, and who had been moving round her to take
    in every point of her quiet, pretty dress; "and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought you across the
    Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I
    was conferring on my friend Mr. Charles!"</p>

    <p>"You didn't mean it," remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, "and therefore how could you know it?
    Nonsense!"</p>

    <p>"Really? Well; but don't cry," said the gentle Mr. Lorry.</p>

    <p>"I am not crying," said Miss Pross; "<em>you</em> are."</p>

    <p>"I, my Pross?" (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her, on occasion.)</p>

    <p>"You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it. Such a present of plate as you have made 'em, is
    enough to bring tears into anybody's eyes. There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection," said Miss Pross, "that
    I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till I couldn't see it."</p>

    <p>"I am highly gratified," said Mr. Lorry, "though, upon my honour, I had no intention of rendering those trifling
    articles of remembrance invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has
    lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!"</p>

    <p>"Not at all!" From Miss Pross.</p>

    <p>"You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?" asked the gentleman of that name.</p>

    <p>"Pooh!" rejoined Miss Pross; "you were a bachelor in your cradle."</p>

    <p>"Well!" observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, "that seems probable, too."</p>

    <p>"And you were cut out for a bachelor," pursued Miss Pross, "before you were put in your cradle."</p>

    <p>"Then, I think," said Mr. Lorry, "that I was very unhandsomely dealt with, and that I ought to have had a voice
    in the selection of my pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie," drawing his arm soothingly round her waist, "I hear
    them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the
    final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave your good father, my dear, in hands as
    earnest and as loving as your own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next fortnight, while you
    are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And
    when, at the fortnight's end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on your other fortnight's trip in
    Wales, you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear
    Somebody's step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before
    Somebody comes to claim his own."</p>

    <p>For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then
    laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which, if such
    things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.</p>

    <p>The door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles Darnay. He was so deadly pale&mdash;which had
    not been the case when they went in together&mdash;that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face. But, in the
    composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy
    indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold wind.</p>

    <p>He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of
    the day. The rest followed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange eyes looked on,
    Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.</p>

    <p>Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done, some diamonds, very
    bright and sparkling, glanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr.
    Lorry's pockets. They returned home to breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had
    mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were mingled with them again in the morning
    sunlight, on the threshold of the door at parting.</p>

    <p>It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father cheered her, and said at last, gently
    disengaging himself from her enfolding arms, "Take her, Charles! She is yours!"</p>

    <p>And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was gone.</p>

    <p>The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the preparations having been very simple and few,
    the Doctor, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the
    cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted
    there, had struck him a poisoned blow.</p>

    <p>He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for
    repression was gone. But, it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent manner of
    clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of
    Defarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.</p>

    <p>"I think," he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, "I think we had best not speak to him just
    now, or at all disturb him. I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back presently. Then,
    we will take him a ride into the country, and dine there, and all will be well."</p>

    <p>It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of Tellson's. He was detained two hours.
    When he came back, he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus into the
    Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.</p>

    <p>"Good God!" he said, with a start. "What's that?"</p>

    <p>Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. "O me, O me! All is lost!" cried she, wringing her hands.
    "What is to be told to Ladybird? He doesn't know me, and is making shoes!"</p>
