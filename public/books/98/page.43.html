    <p>"That is what I mean to tell you, sir," said Mr. Lorry. "Pray let there be no mistake about it."</p>

    <p>Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it,
    which probably gave him the toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:</p>

    <p>"This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not to go up to Soho and offer
    myself&mdash;<em>my</em>self, Stryver of the King's Bench bar?"</p>

    <p>"Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I do."</p>

    <p>"Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly."</p>

    <p>"And all I can say of it is," laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, "that this&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;beats everything
    past, present, and to come."</p>

    <p>"Now understand me," pursued Mr. Lorry. "As a man of business, I am not justified in saying anything about this
    matter, for, as a man of business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried Miss Manette in his
    arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both,
    I have spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I may not be right?"</p>

    <p>"Not I!" said Stryver, whistling. "I can't undertake to find third parties in common sense; I can only find it
    for myself. I suppose sense in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It's new to me, but
    you are right, I dare say."</p>

    <p>"What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself&mdash;And understand me, sir," said Mr. Lorry,
    quickly flushing again, "I will not&mdash;not even at Tellson's&mdash;have it characterised for me by any gentleman
    breathing."</p>

    <p>"There! I beg your pardon!" said Stryver.</p>

    <p>"Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:&mdash;it might be painful to you to find yourself
    mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very
    painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You know the terms upon which I have the honour
    and happiness to stand with the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you in no way, I will
    undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear
    upon it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its soundness for yourself; if, on the other
    hand, you should be satisfied with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is best spared.
    What do you say?"</p>

    <p>"How long would you keep me in town?"</p>

    <p>"Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the evening, and come to your chambers
    afterwards."</p>

    <p>"Then I say yes," said Stryver: "I won't go up there now, I am not so hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes,
    and I shall expect you to look in to-night. Good morning."</p>

    <p>Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a concussion of air on his passage through, that
    to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient
    clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly
    believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another
    customer in.</p>

    <p>The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion
    on any less solid ground than moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow, he got it
    down. "And now," said Mr. Stryver, shaking his forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, "my
    way out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong."</p>

    <p>It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found great relief. "You shall not put me in the
    wrong, young lady," said Mr. Stryver; "I'll do that for you."</p>

    <p>Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock, Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and
    papers littered out for the purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning. He
    even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.</p>

    <p>"Well!" said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of bootless attempts to bring him round to the
    question. "I have been to Soho."</p>

    <p>"To Soho?" repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. "Oh, to be sure! What am I thinking of!"</p>

    <p>"And I have no doubt," said Mr. Lorry, "that I was right in the conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and
    I reiterate my advice."</p>

    <p>"I assure you," returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, "that I am sorry for it on your account, and sorry
    for it on the poor father's account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let us say no more
    about it."</p>

    <p>"I don't understand you," said Mr. Lorry.</p>

    <p>"I dare say not," rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and final way; "no matter, no matter."</p>

    <p>"But it does matter," Mr. Lorry urged.</p>

    <p>"No it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't. Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense, and a
    laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is done. Young
    women have committed similar follies often before, and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In
    an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a
    worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad
    thing for me in a worldly point of view&mdash;it is hardly necessary to say I could have gained nothing by it. There
    is no harm at all done. I have not proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means certain, on
    reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing
    vanities and giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you will always be disappointed.
    Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you, I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.
    And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you, and for giving me your advice; you know the
    young lady better than I do; you were right, it never would have done."</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr. Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with
    an appearance of showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head. "Make the best of it, my dear
    sir," said Stryver; "say no more about it; thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!"</p>
