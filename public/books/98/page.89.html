    <p>"Under a threat?"</p>

    <p>"Oh! Did I say that?"</p>

    <p>"Then, why should I go there?"</p>

    <p>"Really, Mr. Barsad, I can't say, if you can't."</p>

    <p>"Do you mean that you won't say, sir?" the spy irresolutely asked.</p>

    <p>"You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won't."</p>

    <p>Carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill, in such a business
    as he had in his secret mind, and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and made the most
    of it.</p>

    <p>"Now, I told you so," said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his sister; "if any trouble comes of this, it's
    your doing."</p>

    <p>"Come, come, Mr. Barsad!" exclaimed Sydney. "Don't be ungrateful. But for my great respect for your sister, I
    might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction. Do you go
    with me to the Bank?"</p>

    <p>"I'll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I'll go with you."</p>

    <p>"I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street. Let me take your arm, Miss
    Pross. This is not a good city, at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort knows Mr.
    Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry's with us. Are we ready? Come then!"</p>

    <p>Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life remembered, that as she pressed her hands on
    Sydney's arm and looked up in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced purpose in the
    arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the
    man. She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection, and with
    Sydney's friendly reassurances, adequately to heed what she observed.</p>

    <p>They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr. Lorry's, which was within a few minutes'
    walk. John Barsad, or Solomon Pross, walked at his side.</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire&mdash;perhaps
    looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked into the
    red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed
    the surprise with which he saw a stranger.</p>

    <p>"Miss Pross's brother, sir," said Sydney. "Mr. Barsad."</p>

    <p>"Barsad?" repeated the old gentleman, "Barsad? I have an association with the name&mdash;and with the face."</p>

    <p>"I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad," observed Carton, coolly. "Pray sit down."</p>

    <p>As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted, by saying to him with a frown, "Witness
    at that trial." Mr. Lorry immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of
    abhorrence.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of," said Sydney, "and
    has acknowledged the relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again."</p>

    <p>Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, "What do you tell me! I left him safe and free within
    these two hours, and am about to return to him!"</p>

    <p>"Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?"</p>

    <p>"Just now, if at all."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir," said Sydney, "and I have it from Mr. Barsad's communication to
    a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the messengers at the
    gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no earthly doubt that he is retaken."</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point. Confused,
    but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was silently
    attentive.</p>

    <p>"Now, I trust," said Sydney to him, "that the name and influence of Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead
    to-morrow&mdash;you said he would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Yes; I believe so."</p>

    <p>"&mdash;In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by
    Doctor Manette's not having had the power to prevent this arrest."</p>

    <p>"He may not have known of it beforehand," said Mr. Lorry.</p>

    <p>"But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how identified he is with his son-in-law."</p>

    <p>"That's true," Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.</p>

    <p>"In short," said Sydney, "this is a desperate time, when desperate games are played for desperate stakes. Let the
    Doctor play the winning game; I will play the losing one. No man's life here is worth purchase. Any one carried home
    by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst,
    is a friend in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr. Barsad."</p>

    <p>"You need have good cards, sir," said the spy.</p>

    <p>"I'll run them over. I'll see what I hold,&mdash;Mr. Lorry, you know what a brute I am; I wish you'd give me a
    little brandy."</p>

    <p>It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful&mdash;drank off another glassful&mdash;pushed the bottle
    thoughtfully away.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Barsad," he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards: "Sheep of the prisons,
    emissary of Republican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more
    valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than
    a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name. That's a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the
    employ of the republican French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the
    enemy of France and freedom. That's an excellent card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.
    Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the
    Republic crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to
    find. That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr. Barsad?"</p>

    <p>"Not to understand your play," returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.</p>

    <p>"I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and
    see what you have. Don't hurry."</p>

    <p>He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful
    of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he poured out and drank
    another glassful.</p>
