    <p>"Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time."</p>

    <p>It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of.
    Thrown out of his honourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there&mdash;not
    because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very
    modern date&mdash;he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in France: first, as a tempter and
    an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He
    knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop; had received
    from the watchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment, release, and history,
    as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame
    Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered with fear and trembling, that that terrible
    woman had knitted when he talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved. He had since seen
    her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose
    lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as he was did, that he was never safe;
    that flight was impossible; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of his utmost
    tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once
    denounced, and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw that the dreadful woman
    of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would
    quash his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of
    one black suit, to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.</p>

    <p>"You scarcely seem to like your hand," said Sydney, with the greatest composure. "Do you play?"</p>

    <p>"I think, sir," said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr. Lorry, "I may appeal to a gentleman of
    your years and benevolence, to put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can under any
    circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of which he has spoken. I admit that <em>I</em> am a spy,
    and that it is considered a discreditable station&mdash;though it must be filled by somebody; but this gentleman is
    no spy, and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one?"</p>

    <p>"I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad," said Carton, taking the answer on himself, and looking at his watch, "without any
    scruple, in a very few minutes."</p>

    <p>"I should have hoped, gentlemen both," said the spy, always striving to hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, "that
    your respect for my sister&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother," said Sydney
    Carton.</p>

    <p>"You think not, sir?"</p>

    <p>"I have thoroughly made up my mind about it."</p>

    <p>The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his
    usual demeanour, received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,&mdash;who was a mystery to wiser and
    honester men than he,&mdash;that it faltered here and failed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his
    former air of contemplating cards:</p>

    <p>"And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I have another good card here, not yet
    enumerated. That friend and fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons; who was
    he?"</p>

    <p>"French. You don't know him," said the spy, quickly.</p>

    <p>"French, eh?" repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him at all, though he echoed his word. "Well;
    he may be."</p>

    <p>"Is, I assure you," said the spy; "though it's not important."</p>

    <p>"Though it's not important," repeated Carton, in the same mechanical way&mdash;"though it's not
    important&mdash;No, it's not important. No. Yet I know the face."</p>

    <p>"I think not. I am sure not. It can't be," said the spy.</p>

    <p>"It-can't-be," muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his glass (which fortunately was a small one)
    again. "Can't-be. Spoke good French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?"</p>

    <p>"Provincial," said the spy.</p>

    <p>"No. Foreign!" cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a light broke clearly on his mind. "Cly!
    Disguised, but the same man. We had that man before us at the Old Bailey."</p>

    <p>"Now, there you are hasty, sir," said Barsad, with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to
    one side; "there you really give me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this distance of
    time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I attended him in his last illness. He was buried in
    London, at the church of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment
    prevented my following his remains, but I helped to lay him in his coffin."</p>

    <p>Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to
    its source, he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff
    hair on Mr. Cruncher's head.</p>

    <p>"Let us be reasonable," said the spy, "and let us be fair. To show you how mistaken you are, and what an
    unfounded assumption yours is, I will lay before you a certificate of Cly's burial, which I happened to have carried
    in my pocket-book," with a hurried hand he produced and opened it, "ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at
    it! You may take it in your hand; it's no forgery."</p>

    <p>Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His
    hair could not have been more violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the crumpled horn
    in the house that Jack built.</p>

    <p>Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.</p>

    <p>"That there Roger Cly, master," said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and iron-bound visage. "So <em>you</em> put him
    in his coffin?"</p>

    <p>"I did."</p>

    <p>"Who took him out of it?"</p>

    <p>Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, "What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"I mean," said Mr. Cruncher, "that he warn't never in it. No! Not he! I'll have my head took off, if he was ever
    in it."</p>

    <p>The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.</p>
