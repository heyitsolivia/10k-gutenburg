    <p>Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he always pricked up his senses, and became
    excited, when a funeral passed Tellson's. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him
    greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:</p>

    <p>"What is it, brother? What's it about?"</p>

    <p>"<em>I</em> don't know," said the man. "Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!"</p>

    <p>He asked another man. "Who is it?"</p>

    <p>"<em>I</em> don't know," returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless, and vociferating in a
    surprising heat and with the greatest ardour, "Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi&mdash;ies!"</p>

    <p>At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled against him, and from this person he
    learned that the funeral was the funeral of one Roger Cly.</p>

    <p>"Was He a spy?" asked Mr. Cruncher.</p>

    <p>"Old Bailey spy," returned his informant. "Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey Spi&mdash;i&mdash;ies!"</p>

    <p>"Why, to be sure!" exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had assisted. "I've seen him. Dead, is
    he?"</p>

    <p>"Dead as mutton," returned the other, "and can't be too dead. Have 'em out, there! Spies! Pull 'em out, there!
    Spies!"</p>

    <p>The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea, that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and
    loudly repeating the suggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they
    came to a stop. On the crowd's opening the coach doors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their
    hands for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time, that in another moment he was scouring
    away up a bye-street, after shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and other symbolical
    tears.</p>

    <p>These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly
    shut up their shops; for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded. They had already
    got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being
    escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being much needed, this suggestion, too,
    was received with acclamation, and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out, while as many
    people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these
    volunteers was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of Tellson's, in
    the further corner of the mourning coach.</p>

    <p>The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies; but, the river being
    alarmingly near, and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of
    the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief. The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep
    driving the hearse&mdash;advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under close inspection, for the
    purpose&mdash;and with a pieman, also attended by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a
    popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far
    down the Strand; and his bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the
    procession in which he walked.</p>

    <p>Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession
    went its way, recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination was the old church
    of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground;
    finally, accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and highly to its own
    satisfaction.</p>

    <p>The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for
    itself, another brighter genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by, as Old
    Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never
    been near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and they were roughly hustled and
    maltreated. The transition to the sport of window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy
    and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had been pulled down, and some area-railings
    had been torn up, to arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were coming. Before this
    rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the
    usual progress of a mob.</p>

    <p>Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained behind in the churchyard, to confer and
    condole with the undertakers. The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a neighbouring
    public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot.</p>

    <p>"Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way, "you see that there Cly that day, and you
    see with your own eyes that he was a young 'un and a straight made 'un."</p>

    <p>Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned himself about, that he might appear, before
    the hour of closing, on his station at Tellson's. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver, or
    whether his general health had been previously at all amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an
    eminent man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon his medical adviser&mdash;a
    distinguished surgeon&mdash;on his way back.</p>

    <p>Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No job in his absence. The bank closed, the
    ancient clerks came out, the usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.</p>

    <p>"Now, I tell you where it is!" said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on entering. "If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs
    goes wrong to-night, I shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work you for it just the same
    as if I seen you do it."</p>

    <p>The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.</p>

    <p>"Why, you're at it afore my face!" said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of angry apprehension.</p>

    <p>"I am saying nothing."</p>

    <p>"Well, then; don't meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate. You may as well go again me one way as
    another. Drop it altogether."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Jerry."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Jerry," repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. "Ah! It <em>is</em> yes, Jerry. That's about it. You may
    say yes, Jerry."</p>
