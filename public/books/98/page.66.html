    <p>Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was to be desired in the leader of the Saint
    Antoine women. One of her sisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a starved grocer, and the
    mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.</p>

    <p>"Hark!" said The Vengeance. "Listen, then! Who comes?"</p>

    <p>As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been
    suddenly fired, a fast-spreading murmur came rushing along.</p>

    <p>"It is Defarge," said madame. "Silence, patriots!"</p>

    <p>Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked around him! "Listen, everywhere!" said
    madame again. "Listen to him!" Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open mouths, formed
    outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had sprung to their feet.</p>

    <p>"Say then, my husband. What is it?"</p>

    <p>"News from the other world!"</p>

    <p>"How, then?" cried madame, contemptuously. "The other world?"</p>

    <p>"Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people that they might eat grass, and who died, and
    went to Hell?"</p>

    <p>"Everybody!" from all throats.</p>

    <p>"The news is of him. He is among us!"</p>

    <p>"Among us!" from the universal throat again. "And dead?"</p>

    <p>"Not dead! He feared us so much&mdash;and with reason&mdash;that he caused himself to be represented as dead, and
    had a grand mock-funeral. But they have found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in. I have seen
    him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner. I have said that he had reason to fear us. Say all!
    <em>Had</em> he reason?"</p>

    <p>Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had never known it yet, he would have known it
    in his heart of hearts if he could have heard the answering cry.</p>

    <p>A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance
    stooped, and the jar of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.</p>

    <p>"Patriots!" said Defarge, in a determined voice, "are we ready?"</p>

    <p>Instantly Madame Defarge's knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating in the streets, as if it and a drummer
    had flown together by magic; and The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about her head like
    all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to house, rousing the women.</p>

    <p>The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked from windows, caught up what arms they
    had, and came pouring down into the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From such household
    occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare
    ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with the
    wildest cries and actions. Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant Foulon taken, my
    daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and
    screaming, Foulon alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon who told my old father
    that he might eat grass, when I had no bread to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these
    breasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my
    withered father: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers, and young
    men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul
    of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from him! With these cries,
    numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy, whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they
    dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under
    foot.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed.
    Never, if Saint Antoine knew his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out of the Quarter
    so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour
    there was not a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children.</p>

    <p>No. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and
    overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance, and Jacques
    Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance from him in the Hall.</p>

    <p>"See!" cried madame, pointing with her knife. "See the old villain bound with ropes. That was well done to tie a
    bunch of grass upon his back. Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!" Madame put her knife under her arm,
    and clapped her hands as at a play.</p>

    <p>The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them, and
    those again explaining to others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping of
    hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl, and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge's
    frequent expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at a distance: the more readily,
    because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in
    from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the
    building.</p>

    <p>At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or protection, directly down upon the old
    prisoner's head. The favour was too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had stood
    surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got him!</p>

    <p>It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table,
    and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace&mdash;Madame Defarge had but followed and turned her hand in one
    of the ropes with which he was tied&mdash;The Vengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at
    the windows had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high perches&mdash;when the cry seemed
    to go up, all over the city, "Bring him out! Bring him to the lamp!"</p>
