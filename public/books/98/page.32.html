    <p>Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest
    of Holiests to be thrown open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and fawning, what servility,
    what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven&mdash;which
    may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never troubled it.</p>

    <p>Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on
    another, Monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of Truth. There,
    Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the
    chocolate sprites, and was seen no more.</p>

    <p>The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm, and the precious little bells went
    ringing downstairs. There was soon but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm and his
    snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out.</p>

    <p>"I devote you," said this person, stopping at the last door on his way, and turning in the direction of the
    sanctuary, "to the Devil!"</p>

    <p>With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet, and quietly walked
    downstairs.</p>

    <p>He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask. A face of a
    transparent paleness; every feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose, beautifully formed
    otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only
    little change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing colour sometimes, and they would be
    occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of treachery, and
    cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in
    the line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and thin; still, in the
    effect of the face made, it was a handsome face, and a remarkable one.</p>

    <p>Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and drove away. Not many people had talked
    with him at the reception; he had stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer in his
    manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his
    horses, and often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were charging an enemy, and the
    furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had
    sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age, that, in the narrow streets without footways,
    the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner. But, few
    cared enough for that to think of it a second time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were
    left to get out of their difficulties as they could.</p>

    <p>With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these
    days, the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming before it, and men clutching
    each other and clutching children out of its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its
    wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number of voices, and the horses reared and
    plunged.</p>

    <p>But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have stopped; carriages were often known to
    drive on, and leave their wounded behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry, and there
    were twenty hands at the horses' bridles.</p>

    <p>"What has gone wrong?" said Monsieur, calmly looking out.</p>

    <p>A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses, and had laid it on the
    basement of the fountain, and was down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.</p>

    <p>"Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!" said a ragged and submissive man, "it is a child."</p>

    <p>"Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?"</p>

    <p>"Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis&mdash;it is a pity&mdash;yes."</p>

    <p>The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards
    square. As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis
    clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.</p>

    <p>"Killed!" shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring
    at him. "Dead!"</p>

    <p>The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that
    looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the people say
    anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had
    spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had
    been mere rats come out of their holes.</p>

    <p>He took out his purse.</p>

    <p>"It is extraordinary to me," said he, "that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children. One or
    the other of you is for ever in the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give him
    that."</p>

    <p>He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look
    down at it as it fell. The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, "Dead!"</p>

    <p>He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest made way. On seeing him, the miserable
    creature fell upon his shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were stooping
    over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They were as silent, however, as the men.</p>

    <p>"I know all, I know all," said the last comer. "Be a brave man, my Gaspard! It is better for the poor little
    plaything to die so, than to live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour as
    happily?"</p>

    <p>"You are a philosopher, you there," said the Marquis, smiling. "How do they call you?"</p>

    <p>"They call me Defarge."</p>

    <p>"Of what trade?"</p>

    <p>"Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine."</p>

    <p>"Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine," said the Marquis, throwing him another gold coin, "and spend it
    as you will. The horses there; are they right?"</p>

    <p>Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was
    just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had paid for
    it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and
    ringing on its floor.</p>
