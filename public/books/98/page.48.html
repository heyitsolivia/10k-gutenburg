    <p>He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath, it being a spectral sort of race that he
    ran, and one highly desirable to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running
    after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of
    overtaking him and hopping on at his side&mdash;perhaps taking his arm&mdash;it was a pursuer to shun. It was an
    inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out
    into the roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy's Kite without
    tail and wings. It hid in doorways too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up to its
    ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road, and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All
    this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his own door he had
    reason for being half dead. And even then it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
    stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast when he fell asleep.</p>

    <p>From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the
    presence of his father in the family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry inferred,
    from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the
    head-board of the bed.</p>

    <p>"I told you I would," said Mr. Cruncher, "and I did."</p>

    <p>"Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!" his wife implored.</p>

    <p>"You oppose yourself to the profit of the business," said Jerry, "and me and my partners suffer. You was to
    honour and obey; why the devil don't you?"</p>

    <p>"I try to be a good wife, Jerry," the poor woman protested, with tears.</p>

    <p>"Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business? Is it honouring your husband to dishonour his
    business? Is it obeying your husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?"</p>

    <p>"You hadn't taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry."</p>

    <p>"It's enough for you," retorted Mr. Cruncher, "to be the wife of a honest tradesman, and not to occupy your
    female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didn't. A honouring and obeying wife would let
    his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious woman? If you're a religious woman, give me a irreligious one!
    You have no more nat'ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has of a pile, and similarly it must
    be knocked into you."</p>

    <p>The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in the honest tradesman's kicking off his
    clay-soiled boots, and lying down at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him lying on his back,
    with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay down too, and fell asleep again.</p>

    <p>There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr. Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of
    temper, and kept an iron pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case he should
    observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to
    pursue his ostensible calling.</p>

    <p>Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was
    a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and solitude from his
    grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day, and his qualms were gone with the night&mdash;in which particulars
    it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London, that fine morning.</p>

    <p>"Father," said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep at arm's length and to have the stool well
    between them: "what's a Resurrection-Man?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, "How should I know?"</p>

    <p>"I thought you knowed everything, father," said the artless boy.</p>

    <p>"Hem! Well," returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play, "he's a
    tradesman."</p>

    <p>"What's his goods, father?" asked the brisk Young Jerry.</p>

    <p>"His goods," said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, "is a branch of Scientific goods."</p>

    <p>"Persons' bodies, ain't it, father?" asked the lively boy.</p>

    <p>"I believe it is something of that sort," said Mr. Cruncher.</p>

    <p>"Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite growed up!"</p>

    <p>Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way. "It depends upon how you dewelop your
    talents. Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and there's no
    telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for." As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few
    yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to himself: "Jerry, you honest
    tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!"</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">XV. Knitting</h2>
    <p>There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. As early as six o'clock in the
    morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of
    wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin
    wine that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who
    drank it was to make them gloomy. No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur
    Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it.</p>

    <p>This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of
    Monsieur Defarge. It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early brooding than
    drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door,
    who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These were to the full as interested in
    the place, however, as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat, and
    from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy looks.</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop was not visible. He was not missed; for,
    nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in
    her seat, presiding over the distribution of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced
    and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had
    come.</p>
