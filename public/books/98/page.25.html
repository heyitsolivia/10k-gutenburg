    <p>When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a glass that hung against the wall, and
    surveyed himself minutely in it.</p>

    <p>"Do you particularly like the man?" he muttered, at his own image; "why should you particularly like a man who
    resembles you? There is nothing in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have made in
    yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you what you have fallen away from, and what you might
    have been! Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated
    by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow."</p>

    <p>He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with
    his hair straggling over the table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">V. The Jackal</h2>
    <p>Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in
    such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course
    of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous
    exaggeration. The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its
    Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr. Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative
    practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the drier parts of the legal race.</p>

    <p>A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower
    staves of the ladder on which he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite, specially, to
    their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's
    Bench, the florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of the bed of wigs, like a great
    sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.</p>

    <p>It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a
    bold, he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among the most striking
    and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments. But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more
    business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow; and however late at night
    he sat carousing with Sydney Carton, he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning.</p>

    <p>Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's great ally. What the two drank together, between
    Hilary Term and Michaelmas, might have floated a king's ship. Stryver never had a case in hand, anywhere, but Carton
    was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even
    there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going
    home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about, among such as
    were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal,
    and that he rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.</p>

    <p>"Ten o'clock, sir," said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to wake him&mdash;"ten o'clock, sir."</p>

    <p>"<em>What's</em> the matter?"</p>

    <p>"Ten o'clock, sir."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean? Ten o'clock at night?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir. Your honour told me to call you."</p>

    <p>"Oh! I remember. Very well, very well."</p>

    <p>After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire
    continuously for five minutes, he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple, and, having
    revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King's Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver
    chambers.</p>

    <p>The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone home, and the Stryver principal opened the
    door. He had his slippers on, and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease. He had that rather
    wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the
    portrait of Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of Art, through the portraits of
    every Drinking Age.</p>

    <p>"You are a little late, Memory," said Stryver.</p>

    <p>"About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later."</p>

    <p>They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers, where there was a blazing fire. A kettle
    steamed upon the hob, and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon it, and
    brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.</p>

    <p>"You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney."</p>

    <p>"Two to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day's client; or seeing him dine&mdash;it's all one!"</p>

    <p>"That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the identification. How did you come by it? When
    did it strike you?"</p>

    <p>"I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow, if I
    had had any luck."</p>

    <p>Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.</p>

    <p>"You and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work."</p>

    <p>Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining room, and came back with a large jug of
    cold water, a basin, and a towel or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them out, he
    folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down at the table, and said, "Now I am ready!"</p>

    <p>"Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory," said Mr. Stryver, gaily, as he looked among his papers.</p>

    <p>"How much?"</p>

    <p>"Only two sets of them."</p>

    <p>"Give me the worst first."</p>

    <p>"There they are, Sydney. Fire away!"</p>

    <p>The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinking-table, while the jackal sat at
    his own paper-bestrewn table proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand. Both
    resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with
    his hands in his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some lighter document; the jackal,
    with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out
    for his glass&mdash;which often groped about, for a minute or more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or
    three times, the matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up, and steep
    his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear
    as no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity.</p>
