    <p>His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his
    place, and went through the list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three names, but only
    twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had
    already been guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the
    associated prisoners on the night of his arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human
    creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the scaffold.</p>

    <p>There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was soon over. It was the incident of every
    day, and the society of La Force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert, for
    that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments
    had to be refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the common rooms and corridors would
    be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from insensible
    or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a
    species of fervour or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to brave the guillotine
    unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind.
    In seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease&mdash;a terrible passing
    inclination to die of it. And all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke
    them.</p>

    <p>The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next
    day, fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before Charles Darnay's name was called. All the fifteen were condemned,
    and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.</p>

    <p>"Charles Evremonde, called Darnay," was at length arraigned.</p>

    <p>His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress
    otherwise prevailing. Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the usual order of
    things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a
    city, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing spirits of the scene: noisily
    commenting, applauding, disapproving, anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men, the
    greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they
    looked on, many knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked. She
    was in a front row, by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he
    directly remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear, and that she seemed to be
    his wife; but, what he most noticed in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to himself as
    they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination,
    and they looked at the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette, in his usual quiet dress.
    As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr. Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who wore
    their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the Carmagnole.</p>

    <p>Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to
    the Republic, under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing that the decree bore
    date since his return to France. There he was, and there was the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head
    was demanded.</p>

    <p>"Take off his head!" cried the audience. "An enemy to the Republic!"</p>

    <p>The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had
    lived many years in England?</p>

    <p>Undoubtedly it was.</p>

    <p>Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?</p>

    <p>Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.</p>

    <p>Why not? the President desired to know.</p>

    <p>Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him, and a station that was distasteful
    to him, and had left his country&mdash;he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the
    Tribunal was in use&mdash;to live by his own industry in England, rather than on the industry of the overladen
    people of France.</p>

    <p>What proof had he of this?</p>

    <p>He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and Alexandre Manette.</p>

    <p>But he had married in England? the President reminded him.</p>

    <p>True, but not an English woman.</p>

    <p>A citizeness of France?</p>

    <p>Yes. By birth.</p>

    <p>Her name and family?</p>

    <p>"Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who sits there."</p>

    <p>This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the
    hall. So capriciously were the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which
    had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill
    him.</p>

    <p>On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot according to Doctor Manette's reiterated
    instructions. The same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every inch of his
    road.</p>

    <p>The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not sooner?</p>

    <p>He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means of living in France, save those he had
    resigned; whereas, in England, he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature. He had returned
    when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered
    by his absence. He had come back, to save a citizen's life, and to bear his testimony, at whatever personal hazard,
    to the truth. Was that criminal in the eyes of the Republic?</p>

    <p>The populace cried enthusiastically, "No!" and the President rang his bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for
    they continued to cry "No!" until they left off, of their own will.</p>

    <p>The President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness. He
    also referred with confidence to the citizen's letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier, but which he
    did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the President.</p>
