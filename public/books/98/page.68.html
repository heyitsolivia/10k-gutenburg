    <p>Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather, as he sat on his heap of stones under a
    bank, taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail.</p>

    <p>The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill, and at the prison on the crag. When he
    had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just intelligible:</p>

    <p>"How goes it, Jacques?"</p>

    <p>"All well, Jacques."</p>

    <p>"Touch then!"</p>

    <p>They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.</p>

    <p>"No dinner?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing but supper now," said the mender of roads, with a hungry face.</p>

    <p>"It is the fashion," growled the man. "I meet no dinner anywhere."</p>

    <p>He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright
    glow: then, suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb, that blazed
    and went out in a puff of smoke.</p>

    <p>"Touch then." It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time, after observing these operations. They
    again joined hands.</p>

    <p>"To-night?" said the mender of roads.</p>

    <p>"To-night," said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.</p>

    <p>"Where?"</p>

    <p>"Here."</p>

    <p>He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another, with the hail driving in
    between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.</p>

    <p>"Show me!" said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.</p>

    <p>"See!" returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. "You go down here, and straight through the street,
    and past the fountain&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"To the Devil with all that!" interrupted the other, rolling his eye over the landscape. "<em>I</em> go through no
    streets and past no fountains. Well?"</p>

    <p>"Well! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village."</p>

    <p>"Good. When do you cease to work?"</p>

    <p>"At sunset."</p>

    <p>"Will you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without resting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall
    sleep like a child. Will you wake me?"</p>

    <p>"Surely."</p>

    <p>The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his great wooden shoes, and lay down on his
    back on the heap of stones. He was fast asleep directly.</p>

    <p>As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of
    sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap now, in place of
    his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that
    he used his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account. The bronze face, the shaggy black
    hair and beard, the coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts, the
    powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired
    the mender of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were footsore, and his ankles chafed and
    bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues, and his
    clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get
    a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept with his arms crossed upon him, and
    set as resolutely as his lips. Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and drawbridges,
    seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the
    horizon and looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no obstacle, tending to centres all
    over France.</p>

    <p>The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow,
    to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them, until the sun was
    low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then, the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things
    ready to go down into the village, roused him.</p>

    <p>"Good!" said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. "Two leagues beyond the summit of the hill?"</p>

    <p>"About."</p>

    <p>"About. Good!"</p>

    <p>The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind, and was soon
    at the fountain, squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and appearing even to whisper to
    them in his whispering to all the village. When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed, as
    it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and
    also, when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the
    sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle, chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his
    house-top alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by
    the fountain below, and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need to ring
    the tocsin by-and-bye.</p>

    <p>The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its solitary state apart, moved in a rising
    wind, as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace flights of
    steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of
    wind went through the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the stairs, and shook the
    curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four
    heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches, striding on cautiously to come
    together in the courtyard. Four lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all was black
    again.</p>

    <p>But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own, as
    though it were growing luminous. Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front, picking out
    transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches, and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader
    and brighter. Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out
    of fire.</p>

    <p>A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there, and there was a saddling of a horse
    and riding away. There was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the space by the
    village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur Gabelle's door. "Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!" The
    tocsin rang impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The mender of roads, and two hundred and
    fifty particular friends, stood with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the sky. "It must
    be forty feet high," said they, grimly; and never moved.</p>
