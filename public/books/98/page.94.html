    <p>Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected, and gentility hid its head in red
    nightcaps, and put on heavy shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the people poured
    cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a
    mother, looking for a way across the street through the mud. He carried the child over, and before the timid arm was
    loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.</p>

    <p>"I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he
    live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die."</p>

    <p>Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words were in the echoes of his feet, and were in
    the air. Perfectly calm and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he heard them
    always.</p>

    <p>The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it splashed the river-walls of the
    Island of Paris, where the picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light of the moon, the
    day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the sky. Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale
    and died, and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to Death's dominion.</p>

    <p>But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden of the night, straight and warm to his
    heart in its long bright rays. And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light appeared to
    span the air between him and the sun, while the river sparkled under it.</p>

    <p>The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial friend, in the morning stillness. He walked
    by the stream, far from the houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank. When he awoke
    and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless,
    until the stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.&mdash;"Like me."</p>

    <p>A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then glided into his view, floated by him, and
    died away. As its silent track in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for a
    merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors, ended in the words, "I am the resurrection and the
    life."</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone. Sydney
    Carton drank nothing but a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh himself, went
    out to the place of trial.</p>

    <p>The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep&mdash;whom many fell away from in dread&mdash;pressed
    him into an obscure corner among the crowd. Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She was there,
    sitting beside her father.</p>

    <p>When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring
    love and pitying tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy blood into his face,
    brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on
    Sydney Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.</p>

    <p>Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure, ensuring to any accused person any
    reasonable hearing. There could have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not first been
    so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.</p>

    <p>Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day
    before, and to-morrow and the day after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and his
    fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A
    life-thirsting, cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St. Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury
    of dogs empannelled to try the deer.</p>

    <p>Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor. No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day.
    A fell, uncompromising, murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd, and
    gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one another, before bending forward with a strained attention.</p>

    <p>Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused and retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to
    him last night. Suspected and Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants, one of a race
    proscribed, for that they had used their abolished privileges to the infamous oppression of the people. Charles
    Evremonde, called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.</p>

    <p>To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.</p>

    <p>The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?</p>

    <p>"Openly, President."</p>

    <p>"By whom?"</p>

    <p>"Three voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine."</p>

    <p>"Good."</p>

    <p>"Therese Defarge, his wife."</p>

    <p>"Good."</p>

    <p>"Alexandre Manette, physician."</p>

    <p>A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor Manette was seen, pale and trembling,
    standing where he had been seated.</p>

    <p>"President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a fraud. You know the accused to be the
    husband of my daughter. My daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. Who and where is the
    false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband of my child!"</p>

    <p>"Citizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority of the Tribunal would be to put yourself
    out of Law. As to what is dearer to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the Republic."</p>

    <p>Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell, and with warmth resumed.</p>

    <p>"If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself, you would have no duty but to
    sacrifice her. Listen to what is to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!"</p>

    <p>Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down, with his eyes looking around, and his lips
    trembling; his daughter drew closer to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together, and restored the
    usual hand to his mouth.</p>

    <p>Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard, and rapidly expounded the
    story of the imprisonment, and of his having been a mere boy in the Doctor's service, and of the release, and of the
    state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him. This short examination followed, for the court was quick
    with its work.</p>
