    <p>Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband. Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his
    thumb-nail and looking at her, collected his face into a sterner expression.</p>

    <p>"What is it that your husband says in that little letter?" asked Madame Defarge, with a lowering smile.
    "Influence; he says something touching influence?"</p>

    <p>"That my father," said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her
    questioner and not on it, "has much influence around him."</p>

    <p>"Surely it will release him!" said Madame Defarge. "Let it do so."</p>

    <p>"As a wife and mother," cried Lucie, most earnestly, "I implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any
    power that you possess, against my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think of me. As a
    wife and mother!"</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said, turning to her friend The Vengeance:</p>

    <p>"The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little as this child, and much less, have not
    been greatly considered? We have known <em>their</em> husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them, often
    enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in themselves and in their children, poverty,
    nakedness, hunger, thirst, sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?"</p>

    <p>"We have seen nothing else," returned The Vengeance.</p>

    <p>"We have borne this a long time," said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes again upon Lucie. "Judge you! Is it
    likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now?"</p>

    <p>She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge went last, and closed the door.</p>

    <p>"Courage, my dear Lucie," said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. "Courage, courage! So far all goes well with
    us&mdash;much, much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart."</p>

    <p>"I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a shadow on me and on all my hopes."</p>

    <p>"Tut, tut!" said Mr. Lorry; "what is this despondency in the brave little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance
    in it, Lucie."</p>

    <p>But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself, for all that, and in his secret mind it
    troubled him greatly.</p>

    <p>Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence. So much of what had happened in
    that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that not until long
    afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes
    and all ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror;
    and that the air around her had been tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon the
    prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and
    murdered.</p>

    <p>To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell, that the
    crowd had taken him through a scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had found a
    self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were brought singly, and by which they were rapidly
    ordered to be put forth to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back to their cells.
    That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he had announced himself by name and profession as having been
    for eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the body so sitting in judgment had
    risen and identified him, and that this man was Defarge.</p>

    <p>That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table, that his son-in-law was among the living
    prisoners, and had pleaded hard to the Tribunal&mdash;of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some dirty
    with murder and some clean, some sober and some not&mdash;for his life and liberty. That, in the first frantic
    greetings lavished on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded to him to have
    Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once
    released, when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible to the Doctor), which led to
    a few words of secret conference. That, the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that the
    prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on
    a signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the Doctor, had then so
    strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or
    mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings, that
    he had obtained the permission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.</p>

    <p>The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals, shall remain untold. The mad
    joy over the prisoners who were saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were
    cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken
    savage had thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress the wound, the Doctor had passed
    out at the same gate, and had found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies of
    their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare, they had helped the healer,
    and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude&mdash;had made a litter for him and escorted him carefully
    from the spot&mdash;had then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor
    had covered his eyes with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.</p>

    <p>As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of his friend now sixty-two years of age, a
    misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger.</p>

    <p>But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never at all known him in his present character.
    For the first time the Doctor felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time he felt that
    in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which could break the prison door of his daughter's husband, and
    deliver him. "It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin. As my beloved child was
    helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid
    of Heaven I will do it!" Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the
    calm strong look and bearing of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a clock, for so
    many years, and then set going again with an energy which had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness,
    he believed.</p>
