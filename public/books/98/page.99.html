    <p>"My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our conversation. I suspect that I am watched more
    closely than I was, and I know not at what times I may be watched. She had in part suspected, and in part
    discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband's share in it, and my being resorted to. She did not
    know that the girl was dead. Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her, in secret, a woman's
    sympathy. Her hope had been to avert the wrath of Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering
    many.</p>

    <p>"She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and her greatest desire was, to help that
    sister. I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her inducement to
    come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode. Whereas,
    to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>"These scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a warning, yesterday. I must finish my record
    to-day.</p>

    <p>"She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage. How could she be! The brother distrusted and
    disliked her, and his influence was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her husband too.
    When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a pretty boy from two to three years old, in her
    carriage.</p>

    <p>"'For his sake, Doctor,' she said, pointing to him in tears, 'I would do all I can to make what poor amends I
    can. He will never prosper in his inheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement
    is made for this, it will one day be required of him. What I have left to call my own&mdash;it is little beyond the
    worth of a few jewels&mdash;I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the compassion and lamenting
    of his dead mother, on this injured family, if the sister can be discovered.'</p>

    <p>"She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, 'It is for thine own dear sake. Thou wilt be faithful, little
    Charles?' The child answered her bravely, 'Yes!' I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and went away
    caressing him. I never saw her more.</p>

    <p>"As she had mentioned her husband's name in the faith that I knew it, I added no mention of it to my letter. I
    sealed my letter, and, not trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.</p>

    <p>"That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o'clock, a man in a black dress rang at my gate, demanded
    to see me, and softly followed my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my servant came into the room
    where I sat with my wife&mdash;O my wife, beloved of my heart! My fair young English wife!&mdash;we saw the man, who
    was supposed to be at the gate, standing silent behind him.</p>

    <p>"An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. It would not detain me, he had a coach in waiting.</p>

    <p>"It brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear of the house, a black muffler was drawn tightly
    over my mouth from behind, and my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner, and
    identified me with a single gesture. The Marquis took from his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt
    it in the light of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot. Not a word was spoken. I was
    brought here, I was brought to my living grave.</p>

    <p>"If it had pleased <em>God</em> to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers, in all these frightful
    years, to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife&mdash;so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or
    dead&mdash;I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. But, now I believe that the mark of the red
    cross is fatal to them, and that they have no part in His mercies. And them and their descendants, to the last of
    their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony,
    denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven and to earth."</p>

    <p>A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A sound of craving and eagerness that had
    nothing articulate in it but blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time, and there was
    not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.</p>

    <p>Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show how the Defarges had not made the paper
    public, with the other captured Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their time. Little
    need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the
    fatal register. The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that
    day, against such denunciation.</p>

    <p>And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the
    father of his wife. One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of the questionable public
    virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and self-immolations on the people's altar. Therefore when the President
    said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good physician of the Republic would deserve better
    still of the Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and
    joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a
    touch of human sympathy.</p>

    <p>"Much influence around him, has that Doctor?" murmured Madame Defarge, smiling to The Vengeance. "Save him now,
    my Doctor, save him!"</p>

    <p>At every juryman's vote, there was a roar. Another and another. Roar and roar.</p>

    <p>Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the
    People. Back to the Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours!</p>

    <p>The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under the sentence, as if she had been mortally
    stricken. But, she uttered no sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was she of all the
    world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.</p>

    <p>The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors, the Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise
    and movement of the court's emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood stretching out her
    arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face but love and consolation.</p>
