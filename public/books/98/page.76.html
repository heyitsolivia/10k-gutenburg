    <p>"Come!" said the chief, at length taking up his keys, "come with me, emigrant."</p>

    <p>Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase, many doors clanging
    and locking behind them, until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with prisoners of both sexes.
    The women were seated at a long table, reading and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the
    most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the room.</p>

    <p>In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this
    company. But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to receive him, with
    every refinement of manner known to the time, and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.</p>

    <p>So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom, so spectral did they become in the
    inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of
    the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the
    ghost of frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all waiting their dismissal from the
    desolate shore, all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.</p>

    <p>It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the other gaolers moving about, who would have
    been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly coarse
    contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there&mdash;with the apparitions of the coquette,
    the young beauty, and the mature woman delicately bred&mdash;that the inversion of all experience and likelihood
    which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride
    some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!</p>

    <p>"In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune," said a gentleman of courtly appearance and address,
    coming forward, "I have the honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you on the calamity that
    has brought you among us. May it soon terminate happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so
    here, to ask your name and condition?"</p>

    <p>Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in words as suitable as he could find.</p>

    <p>"But I hope," said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his eyes, who moved across the room, "that you
    are not in secret?"</p>

    <p>"I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say so."</p>

    <p>"Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several members of our society have been in secret, at
    first, and it has lasted but a short time." Then he added, raising his voice, "I grieve to inform the
    society&mdash;in secret."</p>

    <p>There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited
    him, and many voices&mdash;among which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous&mdash;gave him
    good wishes and encouragement. He turned at the grated door, to render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the
    gaoler's hand; and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.</p>

    <p>The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half
    an hour already counted them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a solitary cell. It struck
    cold and damp, but was not dark.</p>

    <p>"Yours," said the gaoler.</p>

    <p>"Why am I confined alone?"</p>

    <p>"How do I know!"</p>

    <p>"I can buy pen, ink, and paper?"</p>

    <p>"Such are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At present, you may buy your food, and nothing
    more."</p>

    <p>There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As the gaoler made a general inspection of these
    objects, and of the four walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner
    leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as
    to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was gone, he thought in the same
    wandering way, "Now am I left, as if I were dead." Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it
    with a sick feeling, and thought, "And here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after
    death."</p>

    <p>"Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half." The prisoner
    walked to and fro in his cell, counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a
    wild swell of voices added to them. "He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes." The prisoner counted the
    measurement again, and paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition. "The ghosts that
    vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was
    leaning in the embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden hair, and she looked like * * * *
    Let us ride on again, for God's sake, through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! * * * * He made
    shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and a half." With such scraps tossing and rolling
    upward from the depths of his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting and counting; and
    the roar of the city changed to this extent&mdash;that it still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of
    voices that he knew, in the swell that rose above them.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">II. The Grindstone</h2>
    <p>Tellson's Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was in a wing of a large house, approached by
    a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to a great nobleman
    who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles, in his own cook's dress, and got across the borders. A
    mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur,
    the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in
    question.</p>

    <p>Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages, by
    being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of
    Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur's house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For,
    all things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation, that now upon the third night
    of the autumn month of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneur's house, and had
    marked it with the tri-colour, and were drinking brandy in its state apartments.</p>
