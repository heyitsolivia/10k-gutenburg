    <p>"I have saved him." It was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back; he was really here. And yet
    his wife trembled, and a vague but heavy fear was upon her.</p>

    <p>All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful, the innocent were
    so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that many as
    blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her, every day shared the fate from which he had been
    clutched, that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be. The shadows of the wintry
    afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued
    them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more.</p>

    <p>Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this woman's weakness, which was wonderful to
    see. No garret, no shoemaking, no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task he had set
    himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let them all lean upon him.</p>

    <p>Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was the safest way of life, involving the
    least offence to the people, but because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment, had had to
    pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this
    account, and partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters
    at the courtyard gate, rendered them occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by Mr. Lorry)
    had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every night.</p>

    <p>It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the
    door or doorpost of every house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters of a certain size, at
    a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr. Jerry Cruncher's name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost
    down below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name himself appeared, from overlooking a
    painter whom Doctor Manette had employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called Darnay.</p>

    <p>In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual harmless ways of life were changed. In
    the Doctor's little household, as in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted were
    purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as
    little occasion as possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.</p>

    <p>For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the office of purveyors; the former carrying the
    money; the latter, the basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted, they fared
    forth on this duty, and made and brought home such purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long
    association with a French family, might have known as much of their language as of her own, if she had had a mind,
    she had no mind in that direction; consequently she knew no more of that "nonsense" (as she was pleased to call it)
    than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper
    without any introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be the name of the thing she
    wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always
    made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price, one finger less than the merchant held up,
    whatever his number might be.</p>

    <p>"Now, Mr. Cruncher," said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity; "if you are ready, I am."</p>

    <p>Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service. He had worn all his rust off long ago, but nothing
    would file his spiky head down.</p>

    <p>"There's all manner of things wanted," said Miss Pross, "and we shall have a precious time of it. We want wine,
    among the rest. Nice toasts these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it."</p>

    <p>"It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think," retorted Jerry, "whether they drink your
    health or the Old Un's."</p>

    <p>"Who's he?" said Miss Pross.</p>

    <p>Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning "Old Nick's."</p>

    <p>"Ha!" said Miss Pross, "it doesn't need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures. They have but
    one, and it's Midnight Murder, and Mischief."</p>

    <p>"Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!" cried Lucie.</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes, yes, I'll be cautious," said Miss Pross; "but I may say among ourselves, that I do hope there will be
    no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the streets. Now, Ladybird,
    never you stir from that fire till I come back! Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don't move
    your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again! May I ask a question, Doctor Manette,
    before I go?"</p>

    <p>"I think you may take that liberty," the Doctor answered, smiling.</p>

    <p>"For gracious sake, don't talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of that," said Miss Pross.</p>

    <p>"Hush, dear! Again?" Lucie remonstrated.</p>

    <p>"Well, my sweet," said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, "the short and the long of it is, that I am a
    subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third;" Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; "and as such, my
    maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!"</p>

    <p>Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words after Miss Pross, like somebody at
    church.</p>

    <p>"I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice,"
    said Miss Pross, approvingly. "But the question, Doctor Manette. Is there"&mdash;it was the good creature's way to
    affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all, and to come at it in this chance
    manner&mdash;"is there any prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?"</p>

    <p>"I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet."</p>

    <p>"Heigh-ho-hum!" said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darling's golden hair in the
    light of the fire, "then we must have patience and wait: that's all. We must hold up our heads and fight low, as my
    brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!&mdash;Don't you move, Ladybird!"</p>
