    <p>"We are thoughtful to-night!" said Darnay, drawing his arm about her.</p>

    <p>"Yes, dearest Charles," with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him;
    "we are rather thoughtful to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night."</p>

    <p>"What is it, my Lucie?"</p>

    <p>"Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to ask it?"</p>

    <p>"Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?"</p>

    <p>What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the cheek, and his other hand against the heart
    that beat for him!</p>

    <p>"I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him
    to-night."</p>

    <p>"Indeed, my own? Why so?"</p>

    <p>"That is what you are not to ask me. But I think&mdash;I know&mdash;he does."</p>

    <p>"If you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?"</p>

    <p>"I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very lenient on his faults when he is not by.
    I would ask you to believe that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep wounds in it.
    My dear, I have seen it bleeding."</p>

    <p>"It is a painful reflection to me," said Charles Darnay, quite astounded, "that I should have done him any wrong.
    I never thought this of him."</p>

    <p>"My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is scarcely a hope that anything in his character
    or fortunes is reparable now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things, even magnanimous
    things."</p>

    <p>She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man, that her husband could have looked at her as
    she was for hours.</p>

    <p>"And, O my dearest Love!" she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her head upon his breast, and raising her
    eyes to his, "remember how strong we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!"</p>

    <p>The supplication touched him home. "I will always remember it, dear Heart! I will remember it as long as I
    live."</p>

    <p>He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer
    then pacing the dark streets, could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops of pity kissed
    away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband, he might have cried to the night&mdash;and
    the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time&mdash;</p>

    <p>"God bless her for her sweet compassion!"</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">XXI. Echoing Footsteps</h2>
    <p>A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the
    golden thread which bound her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and companion, in a life
    of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps
    of years.</p>

    <p>At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife, when her work would slowly fall from her
    hands, and her eyes would be dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light, afar off, and
    scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much. Fluttering hopes and doubts&mdash;hopes, of a love as yet
    unknown to her: doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight&mdash;divided her breast. Among the
    echoes then, there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would
    be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her eyes, and broke like waves.</p>

    <p>That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then, among the advancing echoes, there was the tread of
    her tiny feet and the sound of her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young mother at
    the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and the shady house was sunny with a child's laugh, and
    the Divine friend of children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take her child in his arms,
    as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred joy to her.</p>

    <p>Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together, weaving the service of her happy influence
    through the tissue of all their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the echoes of years none
    but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband's step was strong and prosperous among them; her father's firm and
    equal. Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting
    and pawing the earth under the plane-tree in the garden!</p>

    <p>Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like
    her own, lay in a halo on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant smile, "Dear
    papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!"
    those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother's cheek, as the spirit departed from her embrace that
    had been entrusted to it. Suffer them and forbid them not. They see my Father's face. O Father, blessed words!</p>

    <p>Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but
    had in them that breath of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them
    also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmur&mdash;like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a
    sandy shore&mdash;as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her
    mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life.</p>

    <p>The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he
    claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once done
    often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which
    has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.</p>

    <p>No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was
    a wife and a mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him&mdash;an instinctive delicacy of pity for him.
    What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton
    was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms, and he kept his place with her as she grew.
    The little boy had spoken of him, almost at the last. "Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!"</p>
