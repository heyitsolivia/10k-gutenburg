    <p>A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris, would soon have driven the House out of
    its mind and into the Gazette. For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to
    orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid over the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson's had
    whitewashed the Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest linen, aiming (as he very often
    does) at money from morning to night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in Lombard-street,
    London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the
    wall, and also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest provocation. Yet, a French Tellson's
    could get on with these things exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had taken fright at
    them, and drawn out his money.</p>

    <p>What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth, and what would lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate
    and jewels would tarnish in Tellson's hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons, and when they should
    have violently perished; how many accounts with Tellson's never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over
    into the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis Lorry could, though he thought heavily
    of these questions. He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold), and
    on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the
    room distortedly reflect&mdash;a shade of horror.</p>

    <p>He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which he had grown to be a part, like strong
    root-ivy. It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building, but
    the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that
    he did his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade, was extensive standing&mdash;for
    carriages&mdash;where, indeed, some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two
    great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly
    mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy, or other workshop.
    Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire.
    He had opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and he had closed both again, and he
    shivered through his frame.</p>

    <p>From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came the usual night hum of the city, with now
    and then an indescribable ring in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were
    going up to Heaven.</p>

    <p>"Thank God," said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, "that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town
    to-night. May He have mercy on all who are in danger!"</p>

    <p>Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought, "They have come back!" and sat listening.
    But, there was no loud irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate clash again, and all
    was quiet.</p>

    <p>The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great
    change would naturally awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to go among the trusty
    people who were watching it, when his door suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell
    back in amazement.</p>

    <p>Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with that old look of earnestness so
    concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and
    power to it in this one passage of her life.</p>

    <p>"What is this?" cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. "What is the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened?
    What has brought you here? What is it?"</p>

    <p>With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, "O my dear
    friend! My husband!"</p>

    <p>"Your husband, Lucie?"</p>

    <p>"Charles."</p>

    <p>"What of Charles?"</p>

    <p>"Here.</p>

    <p>"Here, in Paris?"</p>

    <p>"Has been here some days&mdash;three or four&mdash;I don't know how many&mdash;I can't collect my thoughts. An
    errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison."</p>

    <p>The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the beg of the great gate rang again, and a
    loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard.</p>

    <p>"What is that noise?" said the Doctor, turning towards the window.</p>

    <p>"Don't look!" cried Mr. Lorry. "Don't look out! Manette, for your life, don't touch the blind!"</p>

    <p>The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and said, with a cool, bold smile:</p>

    <p>"My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in
    Paris&mdash;in Paris? In France&mdash;who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would touch me,
    except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph. My old pain has given me a power that has brought us
    through the barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I knew it would be so; I knew I could
    help Charles out of all danger; I told Lucie so.&mdash;What is that noise?" His hand was again upon the window.</p>

    <p>"Don't look!" cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. "No, Lucie, my dear, nor you!" He got his arm round her, and
    held her. "Don't be so terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to
    Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place. What prison is he in?"</p>

    <p>"La Force!"</p>

    <p>"La Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in your life&mdash;and you were always
    both&mdash;you will compose yourself now, to do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think,
    or I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night; you cannot possibly stir out. I say
    this, because what I must bid you to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must instantly be
    obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a room at the back here. You must leave your father and me
    alone for two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not delay."</p>

    <p>"I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do nothing else than this. I know you are
    true."</p>
