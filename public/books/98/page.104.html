    <p>But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet,
    and that numbers went the same road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate him. Next
    followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet
    fortitude. So, by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his thoughts much higher, and draw
    comfort down.</p>

    <p>Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had travelled thus far on his last way. Being
    allowed to purchase the means of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps
    should be extinguished.</p>

    <p>He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing of her father's imprisonment, until he had
    heard of it from herself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father's and uncle's responsibility for
    that misery, until the paper had been read. He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the
    name he had relinquished, was the one condition&mdash;fully intelligible now&mdash;that her father had attached to
    their betrothal, and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her,
    for her father's sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper,
    or had had it recalled to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on that old Sunday under the
    dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that
    he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners
    which the populace had discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He besought her&mdash;though
    he added that he knew it was needless&mdash;to console her father, by impressing him through every tender means she
    could think of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself, but had
    uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and
    blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured her, as they would
    meet in Heaven, to comfort her father.</p>

    <p>To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her father that he expressly confided his wife
    and child to his care. And he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or
    dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending.</p>

    <p>To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs. That done, with many added sentences of
    grateful friendship and warm attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His mind was so full of the
    others, that he never once thought of him.</p>

    <p>He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When he lay down on his straw bed, he thought
    he had done with this world.</p>

    <p>But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining forms. Free and happy, back in the old house
    in Soho (though it had nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of heart, he was with
    Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he
    had even suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there was no difference in him. Another
    pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it
    flashed upon his mind, "this is the day of my death!"</p>

    <p>Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads were to fall. And now, while he was
    composed, and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking thoughts, which
    was very difficult to master.</p>

    <p>He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How high it was from the ground, how many steps
    it had, where he would be stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed red, which way
    his face would be turned, whether he would be the first, or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in
    nowise directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless times. Neither were they connected
    with fear: he was conscious of no fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do
    when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred; a
    wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.</p>

    <p>The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the numbers he would never hear again. Nine gone
    for ever, ten gone for ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard contest with that
    eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly
    repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over. He could walk up and down, free from distracting
    fancies, praying for himself and for them.</p>

    <p>Twelve gone for ever.</p>

    <p>He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch
    as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep Two before his mind,
    as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen
    others.</p>

    <p>Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very different man from the prisoner, who had
    walked to and fro at La Force, he heard One struck away from him, without surprise. The hour had measured like most
    other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his recovered self-possession, he thought, "There is but another now,"
    and turned to walk again.</p>

    <p>Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He stopped.</p>

    <p>The key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened, or as it opened, a man said in a low voice,
    in English: "He has never seen me here; I have kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I wait near. Lose no
    time!"</p>

    <p>The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the
    light of a smile on his features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.</p>

    <p>There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him
    to be an apparition of his own imagining. But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner's hand, and it
    was his real grasp.</p>
