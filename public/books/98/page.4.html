    <p>His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his
    head. Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and
    growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was so like Smith's work, so much more like the top of a
    strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him, as the most
    dangerous man in the world to go over.</p>

    <p>While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of
    Tellson's Bank, by Temple Bar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took
    such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of <em>her</em> private
    topics of uneasiness. They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.</p>

    <p>What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three
    fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom, likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their
    dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.</p>

    <p>Tellson's Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank passenger&mdash;with an arm drawn through the leathern
    strap, which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving him into his
    corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt&mdash;nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little
    coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became
    the bank, and did a great stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were
    honoured in five minutes than even Tellson's, with all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the
    time. Then the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson's, with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known
    to the passenger (and it was not a little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among them
    with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he
    had last seen them.</p>

    <p>But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach (in a confused way, like the presence of
    pain under an opiate) was always with him, there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all
    through the night. He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave.</p>

    <p>Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person,
    the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by years, and they
    differed principally in the passions they expressed, and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride,
    contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another; so did varieties of sunken cheek,
    cadaverous colour, emaciated hands and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was
    prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre:</p>

    <p>"Buried how long?"</p>

    <p>The answer was always the same: "Almost eighteen years."</p>

    <p>"You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?"</p>

    <p>"Long ago."</p>

    <p>"You know that you are recalled to life?"</p>

    <p>"They tell me so."</p>

    <p>"I hope you care to live?"</p>

    <p>"I can't say."</p>

    <p>"Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?"</p>

    <p>The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes the broken reply was, "Wait! It would kill
    me if I saw her too soon." Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was, "Take me to her."
    Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it was, "I don't know her. I don't understand."</p>

    <p>After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig, and dig, dig&mdash;now with a spade, now
    with a great key, now with his hands&mdash;to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth hanging
    about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The passenger would then start to himself, and lower
    the window, to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.</p>

    <p>Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving patch of light from the lamps, and the
    hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the
    night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong
    rooms, the real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out of the midst of them,
    the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost it again.</p>

    <p>"Buried how long?"</p>

    <p>"Almost eighteen years."</p>

    <p>"I hope you care to live?"</p>

    <p>"I can't say."</p>

    <p>Dig&mdash;dig&mdash;dig&mdash;until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to
    pull up the window, draw his arm securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slumbering forms,
    until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid away into the bank and the grave.</p>

    <p>"Buried how long?"</p>

    <p>"Almost eighteen years."</p>

    <p>"You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?"</p>

    <p>"Long ago."</p>

    <p>The words were still in his hearing as just spoken&mdash;distinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been
    in his life&mdash;when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the shadows of
    the night were gone.</p>

    <p>He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon
    it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood, in which many
    leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky
    was clear, and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.</p>

    <p>"Eighteen years!" said the passenger, looking at the sun. "Gracious Creator of day! To be buried alive for
    eighteen years!"</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">IV. The Preparation</h2>
    <p>When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon, the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel
    opened the coach-door as his custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey from London in
    winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous traveller upon.</p>

    <p>By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated: for the two others had been set
    down at their respective roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp and dirty straw, its
    disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking
    himself out of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and muddy legs, was rather like a
    larger sort of dog.</p>
