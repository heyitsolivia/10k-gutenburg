    <p>"There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The tide will serve pretty nicely at about two
    in the afternoon, sir. Bed, sir?"</p>

    <p>"I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber."</p>

    <p>"And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please. Show Concord! Gentleman's valise and hot water
    to Concord. Pull off gentleman's boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.) Fetch barber to
    Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!"</p>

    <p>The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the mail, and passengers by the mail being always
    heavily wrapped up from head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the Royal George, that
    although but one kind of man was seen to go into it, all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently,
    another drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all loitering by accident at various
    points of the road between the Concord and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a brown
    suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets,
    passed along on his way to his breakfast.</p>

    <p>The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn
    before the fire, and as he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still, that he might
    have been sitting for his portrait.</p>

    <p>Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under
    his flapped waist-coat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the
    brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were
    of a fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen
    wig, setting very close to his head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more as
    though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass. His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his
    stockings, was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks of sail that
    glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint
    wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the
    composed and reserved expression of Tellson's Bank. He had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though
    lined, bore few traces of anxiety. But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson's Bank were principally
    occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off
    and on.</p>

    <p>Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait, Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival
    of his breakfast roused him, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:</p>

    <p>"I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis
    Lorry, or she may only ask for a gentleman from Tellson's Bank. Please to let me know."</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir. Tellson's Bank in London, sir?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards
    betwixt London and Paris, sir. A vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company's House."</p>

    <p>"Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one."</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think, sir?"</p>

    <p>"Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we&mdash;since I&mdash;came last from France."</p>

    <p>"Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people's time here, sir. The George was in other
    hands at that time, sir."</p>

    <p>"I believe so."</p>

    <p>"But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty,
    not to speak of fifteen years ago?"</p>

    <p>"You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from the truth."</p>

    <p>"Indeed, sir!"</p>

    <p>Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the table, the waiter shifted his napkin from
    his right arm to his left, dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while he ate and
    drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.</p>

    <p>When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on the beach. The little narrow, crooked town
    of Dover hid itself away from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich. The beach
    was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was
    destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the coast down, madly. The air among
    the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it,
    as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling
    about by night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and was near flood. Small
    tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that
    nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.</p>

    <p>As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been at intervals clear enough to allow the French
    coast to be seen, became again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry's thoughts seemed to cloud too. When it was
    dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was
    busily digging, digging, digging, in the live red coals.</p>

    <p>A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency
    to throw him out of work. Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last glassful of wine
    with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion
    who has got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow street, and rumbled into the
    inn-yard.</p>

    <p>He set down his glass untouched. "This is Mam'selle!" said he.</p>

    <p>In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette had arrived from London, and would be
    happy to see the gentleman from Tellson's.</p>

    <p>"So soon?"</p>

    <p>Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none then, and was extremely anxious to see the
    gentleman from Tellson's immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.</p>
