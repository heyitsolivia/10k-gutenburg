    <p>Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud
    on the theme: broaching to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face
    of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the
    abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of
    objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his
    word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.</p>

    <p>The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet
    discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that
    he saw the direction&mdash;the more quickly because it was his own right name. The address, turned into English,
    ran:</p>

    <p>"Very pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of France. Confided to the cares of Messrs.
    Tellson and Co., Bankers, London, England."</p>

    <p>On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that
    the secret of this name should be&mdash;unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation&mdash;kept inviolate between
    them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.</p>

    <p>"No," said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; "I have referred it, I think, to everybody now here, and no one can
    tell me where this gentleman is to be found."</p>

    <p>The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there was a general set of the current of
    talkers past Mr. Lorry's desk. He held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the person of
    this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at it in the person of that plotting and indignant
    refugee; and This, That, and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in English, concerning
    the Marquis who was not to be found.</p>

    <p>"Nephew, I believe&mdash;but in any case degenerate successor&mdash;of the polished Marquis who was murdered,"
    said one. "Happy to say, I never knew him."</p>

    <p>"A craven who abandoned his post," said another&mdash;this Monseigneur had been got out of Paris, legs uppermost
    and half suffocated, in a load of hay&mdash;"some years ago."</p>

    <p>"Infected with the new doctrines," said a third, eyeing the direction through his glass in passing; "set himself
    in opposition to the last Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to the ruffian herd.
    They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves."</p>

    <p>"Hey?" cried the blatant Stryver. "Did he though? Is that the sort of fellow? Let us look at his infamous name.
    D&mdash;n the fellow!"</p>

    <p>Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on the shoulder, and said:</p>

    <p>"I know the fellow."</p>

    <p>"Do you, by Jupiter?" said Stryver. "I am sorry for it."</p>

    <p>"Why?"</p>

    <p>"Why, Mr. Darnay? D'ye hear what he did? Don't ask, why, in these times."</p>

    <p>"But I do ask why?"</p>

    <p>"Then I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary
    questions. Here is a fellow, who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was
    known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why
    I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I'll answer you. I am sorry because I believe there
    is contamination in such a scoundrel. That's why."</p>

    <p>Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and said: "You may not understand the
    gentleman."</p>

    <p>"I understand how to put <em>you</em> in a corner, Mr. Darnay," said Bully Stryver, "and I'll do it. If this fellow
    is a gentleman, I <em>don't</em> understand him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also tell him, from
    me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of
    them. But, no, gentlemen," said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers, "I know something of human
    nature, and I tell you that you'll never find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such
    precious <em>prot�g�s</em>. No, gentlemen; he'll always show 'em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle, and
    sneak away."</p>

    <p>With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the
    general approbation of his hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk, in the general
    departure from the Bank.</p>

    <p>"Will you take charge of the letter?" said Mr. Lorry. "You know where to deliver it?"</p>

    <p>"I do."</p>

    <p>"Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been addressed here, on the chance of our knowing
    where to forward it, and that it has been here some time?"</p>

    <p>"I will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?"</p>

    <p>"From here, at eight."</p>

    <p>"I will come back, to see you off."</p>

    <p>Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men, Darnay made the best of his way into the
    quiet of the Temple, opened the letter, and read it. These were its contents:</p>

    <p>"Prison of the Abbaye, Paris.</p>

    <p>"June 21, 1792. "MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS.</p>

    <p>"After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village, I have been seized, with great violence
    and indignity, and brought a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a great deal. Nor is that
    all; my house has been destroyed&mdash;razed to the ground.</p>

    <p>"The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, and for which I shall be summoned before
    the tribunal, and shall lose my life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against the majesty
    of the people, in that I have acted against them for an emigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have acted for
    them, and not against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent that, before the sequestration of
    emigrant property, I had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had had
    recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for an emigrant, and where is that emigrant?</p>

    <p>"Ah! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that emigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I
    demand of Heaven, will he not come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I send my desolate
    cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!</p>
