    <p>Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would have yielded before his persevering
    purpose. While he kept himself in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees of mankind, bond
    and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting
    physician of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer
    confined alone, but was mixed with the general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet
    messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her (though never by the
    Doctor's hand), but she was not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of plots in the
    prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections
    abroad.</p>

    <p>This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a
    new sustaining pride in it. Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one; but he observed it
    as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his
    daughter and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness. Now that this was changed, and he
    knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's ultimate
    safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he took the lead and direction, and required
    them as the weak, to trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were
    reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but
    in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. "All curious to see," thought Mr. Lorry, in his
    amiably shrewd way, "but all natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn't be in
    better hands."</p>

    <p>But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to
    get him brought to trial, the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new era began; the
    king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory
    or death against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame; three
    hundred thousand men, summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France,
    as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in
    gravel, and alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in fell and forest,
    in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful
    banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore. What private solicitude could rear itself against the
    deluge of the Year One of Liberty&mdash;the deluge rising from below, not falling from above, and with the windows
    of Heaven shut, not opened!</p>

    <p>There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no measurement of time. Though days and
    nights circled as regularly as when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other count of
    time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now,
    breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the head of the king&mdash;and
    now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned
    widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.</p>

    <p>And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases, the time was long, while it
    flamed by so fast. A revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all
    over the land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any
    good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence, and
    could obtain no hearing; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be
    ancient usage before they were many weeks old. Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been
    before the general gaze from the foundations of the world&mdash;the figure of the sharp female called La
    Guillotine.</p>

    <p>It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache, it infallibly prevented the hair from
    turning grey, it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which shaved close: who
    kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the
    regeneration of the human race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts from which the Cross was
    discarded, and it was bowed down to and believed in where the Cross was denied.</p>

    <p>It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted, were a rotten red. It was taken to
    pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed the
    eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark,
    twenty-one living and one dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes. The name of the
    strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger
    than his namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God's own Temple every day.</p>

    <p>Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked with a steady head: confident in his
    power, cautiously persistent in his end, never doubting that he would save Lucie's husband at last. Yet the current
    of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one
    year and three months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more wicked and distracted had the
    Revolution grown in that December month, that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the
    violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares under the southern wintry sun. Still, the
    Doctor walked among the terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at that day; no man in a
    stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and
    victims, he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive
    removed him from all other men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if he had indeed been
    recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were a Spirit moving among mortals.</p>
