    <p>The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was come, and Monseigneur was by this time
    scattered far and wide.</p>

    <p>As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank.
    Spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur without a guinea haunted
    the spot where his guineas used to be. Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be
    relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson's was a munificent house, and extended great liberality to old customers
    who had fallen from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time, and anticipating
    plunder or confiscation, had made provident remittances to Tellson's, were always to be heard of there by their
    needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer from France reported himself and his tidings at
    Tellson's, almost as a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that time, as to French
    intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were
    in consequence so numerous, that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the
    Bank windows, for all who ran through Temple Bar to read.</p>

    <p>On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with
    him in a low voice. The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now the news-Exchange, and
    was filled to overflowing. It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing.</p>

    <p>"But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived," said Charles Darnay, rather hesitating, "I must still
    suggest to you&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I understand. That I am too old?" said Mr. Lorry.</p>

    <p>"Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a disorganised country, a city that may not be
    even safe for you."</p>

    <p>"My dear Charles," said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, "you touch some of the reasons for my going: not for
    my staying away. It is safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore
    when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it
    were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there, who
    knows the city and the business, of old, and is in Tellson's confidence. As to the uncertain travelling, the long
    journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of
    Tellson's, after all these years, who ought to be?"</p>

    <p>"I wish I were going myself," said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly, and like one thinking aloud.</p>

    <p>"Indeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!" exclaimed Mr. Lorry. "You wish you were going yourself?
    And you a Frenchman born? You are a wise counsellor."</p>

    <p>"My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the thought (which I did not mean to utter here,
    however) has passed through my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for the miserable
    people, and having abandoned something to them," he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner, "that one might be
    listened to, and might have the power to persuade to some restraint. Only last night, after you had left us, when I
    was talking to Lucie&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"When you were talking to Lucie," Mr. Lorry repeated. "Yes. I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of
    Lucie! Wishing you were going to France at this time of day!"</p>

    <p>"However, I am not going," said Charles Darnay, with a smile. "It is more to the purpose that you say you
    are."</p>

    <p>"And I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles," Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and lowered
    his voice, "you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and of the peril in
    which our books and papers over yonder are involved. The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would
    be to numbers of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they might be, at any time, you
    know, for who can say that Paris is not set afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these
    with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise getting of them out of harm's way, is within
    the power (without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall I hang back, when
    Tellson's knows this and says this&mdash;Tellson's, whose bread I have eaten these sixty years&mdash;because I am a
    little stiff about the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!"</p>

    <p>"How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry."</p>

    <p>"Tut! Nonsense, sir!&mdash;And, my dear Charles," said Mr. Lorry, glancing at the House again, "you are to
    remember, that getting things out of Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an impossibility.
    Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not
    business-like to whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine, every one of whom had his head
    hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as
    in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped."</p>

    <p>"And do you really go to-night?"</p>

    <p>"I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay."</p>

    <p>"And do you take no one with you?"</p>

    <p>"All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing to say to any of them. I intend to take
    Jerry. Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him. Nobody will suspect
    Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who
    touches his master."</p>

    <p>"I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness."</p>

    <p>"I must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this little commission, I shall, perhaps, accept
    Tellson's proposal to retire and live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old."</p>

    <p>This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry's usual desk, with Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it,
    boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too much the way of
    Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk
    of this terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been
    sown&mdash;as if nothing had ever been done, or omitted to be done, that had led to it&mdash;as if observers of the
    wretched millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous, had
    not seen it inevitably coming, years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such vapouring,
    combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly
    exhausted itself, and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured without some remonstrance
    by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of
    blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and
    which still kept him so.</p>
