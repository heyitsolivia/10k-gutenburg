    <p>There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall, with a stone screen before it, so that the
    sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred across, a few feet
    within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed.
    There were the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.</p>

    <p>"Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them," said Defarge to the turnkey.</p>

    <p>The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Stop!&mdash;Look here, Jacques!"</p>

    <p>"A. M.!" croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.</p>

    <p>"Alexandre Manette," said Defarge in his ear, following the letters with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained
    with gunpowder. "And here he wrote 'a poor physician.' And it was he, without doubt, who scratched a calendar on
    this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it me!"</p>

    <p>He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden exchange of the two instruments, and
    turning on the worm-eaten stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.</p>

    <p>"Hold the light higher!" he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. "Look among those fragments with care, Jacques. And
    see! Here is my knife," throwing it to him; "rip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold the light higher,
    you!"</p>

    <p>With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and, peering up the chimney, struck and prised at
    its sides with the crowbar, and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes, some mortar and dust came
    dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the
    chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a cautious touch.</p>

    <p>"Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing."</p>

    <p>"Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light them, you!"</p>

    <p>The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door,
    they left it burning, and retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they
    came down, until they were in the raging flood once more.</p>

    <p>They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop
    keeper foremost in the guard upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people. Otherwise, the
    governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the
    people's blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be unavenged.</p>

    <p>In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in
    his grey coat and red decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a woman's. "See, there is my
    husband!" she cried, pointing him out. "See Defarge!" She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and
    remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore
    him along; remained immovable close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to be struck at from
    behind; remained immovable close to him when the long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to
    him when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot upon his neck, and with her cruel
    knife&mdash;long ready&mdash;hewed off his head.</p>

    <p>The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what
    he could be and do. Saint Antoine's blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was
    down&mdash;down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the governor's body lay&mdash;down on the sole of the shoe
    of Madame Defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation. "Lower the lamp yonder!" cried
    Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new means of death; "here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!" The
    swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.</p>

    <p>The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave, whose depths were yet
    unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes, voices of
    vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.</p>

    <p>But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life, there were two groups of
    faces&mdash;each seven in number&mdash;so fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore more
    memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were
    carried high overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last Day were come, and those who
    rejoiced around them were lost spirits. Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose
    drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Impassive faces, yet with a suspended&mdash;not an
    abolished&mdash;expression on them; faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped lids of
    the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, "THOU DIDST IT!"</p>

    <p>Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the accursed fortress of the eight strong
    towers, some discovered letters and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken
    hearts,&mdash;such, and such&mdash;like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint Antoine escort through the Paris
    streets in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay, and
    keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad, and dangerous; and in the years so long after the
    breaking of the cask at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once stained red.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">XXII. The Sea Still Rises</h2>
    <p>Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to
    such extent as he could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame Defarge sat at her
    counter, as usual, presiding over the customers. Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood
    of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint's mercies. The
    lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them.</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the
    street. In both, there were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense of power
    enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in
    it: "I know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself; but do you know how easy it
    has grown for me, the wearer of this, to destroy life in you?" Every lean bare arm, that had been without work
    before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike. The fingers of the knitting women were vicious,
    with the experience that they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine; the image had been
    hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.</p>
