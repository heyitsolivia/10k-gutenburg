    <p>What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity,
    except that it was something very voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss Pross and
    her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be
    recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but, Mr. Cruncher&mdash;though it seemed on
    his own separate and individual account&mdash;was in a state of the greatest wonder.</p>

    <p>"What is the matter?" said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though
    in a low tone), and in English.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!" cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again. "After not setting eyes upon you or
    hearing of you for so long a time, do I find you here!"</p>

    <p>"Don't call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?" asked the man, in a furtive, frightened way.</p>

    <p>"Brother, brother!" cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. "Have I ever been so hard with you that you ask me
    such a cruel question?"</p>

    <p>"Then hold your meddlesome tongue," said Solomon, "and come out, if you want to speak to me. Pay for your wine,
    and come out. Who's this man?"</p>

    <p>Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother, said through her tears,
    "Mr. Cruncher."</p>

    <p>"Let him come out too," said Solomon. "Does he think me a ghost?"</p>

    <p>Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the
    depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did so, Solomon turned to
    the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French
    language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits.</p>

    <p>"Now," said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, "what do you want?"</p>

    <p>"How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from!" cried Miss Pross, "to give me
    such a greeting, and show me no affection."</p>

    <p>"There. Confound it! There," said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross's lips with his own. "Now are you
    content?"</p>

    <p>Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.</p>

    <p>"If you expect me to be surprised," said her brother Solomon, "I am not surprised; I knew you were here; I know
    of most people who are here. If you really don't want to endanger my existence&mdash;which I half believe you
    do&mdash;go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I am an official."</p>

    <p>"My English brother Solomon," mourned Miss Pross, casting up her tear-fraught eyes, "that had the makings in him
    of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and such foreigners! I
    would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I said so!" cried her brother, interrupting. "I knew it. You want to be the death of me. I shall be rendered
    Suspected, by my own sister. Just as I am getting on!"</p>

    <p>"The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!" cried Miss Pross. "Far rather would I never see you again, dear
    Solomon, though I have ever loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me, and tell me there
    is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will detain you no longer."</p>

    <p>Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not
    known it for a fact, years ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent her money and left
    her!</p>

    <p>He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could
    have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case, all the world
    over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder, hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following
    singular question:</p>

    <p>"I say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon, or Solomon John?"</p>

    <p>The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not previously uttered a word.</p>

    <p>"Come!" said Mr. Cruncher. "Speak out, you know." (Which, by the way, was more than he could do himself.) "John
    Solomon, or Solomon John? She calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And <em>I</em> know you're
    John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that name of Pross, likewise. That warn't your name over
    the water."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Well, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your name was, over the water."</p>

    <p>"No?"</p>

    <p>"No. But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables."</p>

    <p>"Indeed?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. T'other one's was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy&mdash;witness at the Bailey. What, in the name of
    the Father of Lies, own father to yourself, was you called at that time?"</p>

    <p>"Barsad," said another voice, striking in.</p>

    <p>"That's the name for a thousand pound!" cried Jerry.</p>

    <p>The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat,
    and he stood at Mr. Cruncher's elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.</p>

    <p>"Don't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry's, to his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed
    that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present myself here, to
    beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake
    Mr. Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons."</p>

    <p>Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked
    him how he dared&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I'll tell you," said Sydney. "I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I
    was contemplating the walls, an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember faces well. Made
    curious by seeing you in that connection, and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you
    with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your direction. I walked into the wine-shop here,
    close after you, and sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation, and the rumour
    openly going about among your admirers, the nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed
    to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad."</p>

    <p>"What purpose?" the spy asked.</p>

    <p>"It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the street. Could you favour me, in confidence,
    with some minutes of your company&mdash;at the office of Tellson's Bank, for instance?"</p>
