    <p>Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like,
    cottages in twos and threes, avenues of leafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back by another
    road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven, no. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are
    pursued! Hush! the posting-house.</p>

    <p>Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in the little street, bereft of horses, and
    with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible existence, one by one;
    leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions
    count their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results. All the time, our overfraught hearts
    are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.</p>

    <p>At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left behind. We are through the village, up
    the hill, and down the hill, and on the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with animated
    gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their haunches. We are pursued?</p>

    <p>"Ho! Within the carriage there. Speak then!"</p>

    <p>"What is it?" asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.</p>

    <p>"How many did they say?"</p>

    <p>"I do not understand you."</p>

    <p>"&mdash;At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?"</p>

    <p>"Fifty-two."</p>

    <p>"I said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have it forty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The
    Guillotine goes handsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!"</p>

    <p>The night comes on dark. He moves more; he is beginning to revive, and to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are
    still together; he asks him, by his name, what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help us! Look out,
    look out, and see if we are pursued.</p>

    <p>The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and the moon is plunging after us, and the
    whole wild night is in pursuit of us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">XIV. The Knitting Done</h2>
    <p>In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council
    with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame Defarge confer with
    these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer, erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate
    in the conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required, or
    to offer an opinion until invited.</p>

    <p>"But our Defarge," said Jacques Three, "is undoubtedly a good Republican? Eh?"</p>

    <p>"There is no better," the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill notes, "in France."</p>

    <p>"Peace, little Vengeance," said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenant's lips,
    "hear me speak. My husband, fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved well of the
    Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards
    this Doctor."</p>

    <p>"It is a great pity," croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head, with his cruel fingers at his hungry
    mouth; "it is not quite like a good citizen; it is a thing to regret."</p>

    <p>"See you," said madame, "I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear his head or lose it, for any interest I
    have in him; it is all one to me. But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and child must
    follow the husband and father."</p>

    <p>"She has a fine head for it," croaked Jacques Three. "I have seen blue eyes and golden hair there, and they
    looked charming when Samson held them up." Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.</p>

    <p>"The child also," observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of his words, "has golden hair and blue
    eyes. And we seldom have a child there. It is a pretty sight!"</p>

    <p>"In a word," said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction, "I cannot trust my husband in this matter.
    Not only do I feel, since last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects; but also I feel
    that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning, and then they might escape."</p>

    <p>"That must never be," croaked Jacques Three; "no one must escape. We have not half enough as it is. We ought to
    have six score a day."</p>

    <p>"In a word," Madame Defarge went on, "my husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation, and
    I have not his reason for regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself, therefore. Come hither,
    little citizen."</p>

    <p>The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his
    hand to his red cap.</p>

    <p>"Touching those signals, little citizen," said Madame Defarge, sternly, "that she made to the prisoners; you are
    ready to bear witness to them this very day?"</p>

    <p>"Ay, ay, why not!" cried the sawyer. "Every day, in all weathers, from two to four, always signalling, sometimes
    with the little one, sometimes without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes."</p>

    <p>He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity
    of signals that he had never seen.</p>

    <p>"Clearly plots," said Jacques Three. "Transparently!"</p>

    <p>"There is no doubt of the Jury?" inquired Madame Defarge, letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.</p>

    <p>"Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my fellow-Jurymen."</p>

    <p>"Now, let me see," said Madame Defarge, pondering again. "Yet once more! Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I
    have no feeling either way. Can I spare him?"</p>

    <p>"He would count as one head," observed Jacques Three, in a low voice. "We really have not heads enough; it would
    be a pity, I think."</p>

    <p>"He was signalling with her when I saw her," argued Madame Defarge; "I cannot speak of one without the other; and
    I must not be silent, and trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a bad witness."</p>

    <p>The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most
    admirable and marvellous of witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a celestial
    witness.</p>

    <p>"He must take his chance," said Madame Defarge. "No, I cannot spare him! You are engaged at three o'clock; you
    are going to see the batch of to-day executed.&mdash;You?"</p>
