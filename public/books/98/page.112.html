    <p>"Bad Fortune!" cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, "and here are the tumbrils! And Evremonde
    will be despatched in a wink, and she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for her. I
    cry with vexation and disappointment!"</p>

    <p>As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads. The ministers
    of Sainte Guillotine are robed and ready. Crash!&mdash;A head is held up, and the knitting-women who scarcely lifted
    their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak, count One.</p>

    <p>The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up. Crash!&mdash;And the knitting-women, never faltering
    or pausing in their Work, count Two.</p>

    <p>The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next after him. He has not relinquished her
    patient hand in getting out, but still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to the crashing
    engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into his face and thanks him.</p>

    <p>"But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart;
    nor should I have been able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might have hope and comfort
    here to-day. I think you were sent to me by Heaven."</p>

    <p>"Or you to me," says Sydney Carton. "Keep your eyes upon me, dear child, and mind no other object."</p>

    <p>"I mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when I let it go, if they are rapid."</p>

    <p>"They will be rapid. Fear not!"</p>

    <p>The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to
    voice, hand to hand, heart to heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart and differing,
    have come together on the dark highway, to repair home together, and to rest in her bosom.</p>

    <p>"Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I am very ignorant, and it troubles
    me&mdash;just a little."</p>

    <p>"Tell me what it is."</p>

    <p>"I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I love very dearly. She is five years younger
    than I, and she lives in a farmer's house in the south country. Poverty parted us, and she knows nothing of my
    fate&mdash;for I cannot write&mdash;and if I could, how should I tell her! It is better as it is."</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes: better as it is."</p>

    <p>"What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still thinking now, as I look into your kind strong
    face which gives me so much support, is this:&mdash;If the Republic really does good to the poor, and they come to
    be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may live a long time: she may even live to be old."</p>

    <p>"What then, my gentle sister?"</p>

    <p>"Do you think:" the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a
    little more and tremble: "that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land where I trust both
    you and I will be mercifully sheltered?"</p>

    <p>"It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there."</p>

    <p>"You comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now? Is the moment come?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other. The spare hand does not tremble as he
    releases it; nothing worse than a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before him&mdash;is
    gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.</p>

    <p>"I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he
    live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."</p>

    <p>The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of
    the crowd, so that it swells forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away. Twenty-Three.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the peacefullest man's face ever beheld there. Many
    added that he looked sublime and prophetic.</p>

    <p>One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe&mdash;a woman&mdash;had asked at the foot of the same
    scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her. If he had given any
    utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:</p>

    <p>"I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the Judge, long ranks of the new oppressors who have
    risen on the destruction of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease out of its
    present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be
    truly free, in their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil of this time and of the
    previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.</p>

    <p>"I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy, in that England which I
    shall see no more. I see Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father, aged and bent, but
    otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his healing office, and at peace. I see the good old man, so long
    their friend, in ten years' time enriching them with all he has, and passing tranquilly to his reward.</p>

    <p>"I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. I see
    her, an old woman, weeping for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their course done,
    lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the
    other's soul, than I was in the souls of both.</p>

    <p>"I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man winning his way up in that path of life
    which once was mine. I see him winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his. I see
    the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him, fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my
    name, with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place&mdash;then fair to look upon, with not a trace of
    this day's disfigurement&mdash;and I hear him tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.</p>

    <p>"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I
    have ever known."</p>
