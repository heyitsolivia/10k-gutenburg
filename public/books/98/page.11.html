    <p>"The door is locked then, my friend?" said Mr. Lorry, surprised.</p>

    <p>"Ay. Yes," was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.</p>

    <p>"You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?"</p>

    <p>"I think it necessary to turn the key." Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his ear, and frowned
    heavily.</p>

    <p>"Why?"</p>

    <p>"Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be frightened&mdash;rave&mdash;tear himself to
    pieces&mdash;die&mdash;come to I know not what harm&mdash;if his door was left open."</p>

    <p>"Is it possible!" exclaimed Mr. Lorry.</p>

    <p>"Is it possible!" repeated Defarge, bitterly. "Yes. And a beautiful world we live in, when it <em>is</em> possible,
    and when many other such things are possible, and not only possible, but done&mdash;done, see you!&mdash;under that
    sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on."</p>

    <p>This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word of it had reached the young lady's ears.
    But, by this time she trembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety, and, above all,
    such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.</p>

    <p>"Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a moment; it is but passing the room-door, and
    the worst is over. Then, all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring to him, begin.
    Let our good friend here, assist you on that side. That's well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!"</p>

    <p>They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were soon at the top. There, as it had an
    abrupt turn in it, they came all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at the
    side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes
    in the wall. On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three
    of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop.</p>

    <p>"I forgot them in the surprise of your visit," explained Monsieur Defarge. "Leave us, good boys; we have business
    here."</p>

    <p>The three glided by, and went silently down.</p>

    <p>There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one
    when they were left alone, Mr. Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:</p>

    <p>"Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?"</p>

    <p>"I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few."</p>

    <p>"Is that well?"</p>

    <p>"<em>I</em> think it is well."</p>

    <p>"Who are the few? How do you choose them?"</p>

    <p>"I choose them as real men, of my name&mdash;Jacques is my name&mdash;to whom the sight is likely to do good.
    Enough; you are English; that is another thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment."</p>

    <p>With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall. Soon
    raising his head again, he struck twice or thrice upon the door&mdash;evidently with no other object than to make a
    noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into
    the lock, and turned it as heavily as he could.</p>

    <p>The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the room and said something. A faint voice
    answered something. Little more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.</p>

    <p>He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry got his arm securely round the daughter's
    waist, and held her; for he felt that she was sinking.</p>

    <p>"A-a-a-business, business!" he urged, with a moisture that was not of business shining on his cheek. "Come in,
    come in!"</p>

    <p>"I am afraid of it," she answered, shuddering.</p>

    <p>"Of it? What?"</p>

    <p>"I mean of him. Of my father."</p>

    <p>Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of their conductor, he drew over his neck the
    arm that shook upon his shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her down just within
    the door, and held her, clinging to him.</p>

    <p>Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside, took out the key again, and held it in his
    hand. All this he did, methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he could make. Finally,
    he walked across the room with a measured tread to where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.</p>

    <p>The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim and dark: for, the window of dormer
    shape, was in truth a door in the roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from the street:
    unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any other door of French construction. To exclude the cold,
    one half of this door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way. Such a scanty portion of
    light was admitted through these means, that it was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit
    alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work
    of that kind was being done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face towards the window
    where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and
    very busy, making shoes.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">VI. The Shoemaker</h2>
    <p>"Good day!" said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking.</p>

    <p>It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the salutation, as if it were at a distance:</p>

    <p>"Good day!"</p>

    <p>"You are still hard at work, I see?"</p>

    <p>After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the voice replied, "Yes&mdash;I am working."
    This time, a pair of haggard eyes had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.</p>

    <p>The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the faintness of physical weakness, though
    confinement and hard fare no doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was the faintness
    of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost
    the life and resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once beautiful colour faded away into
    a poor weak stain. So sunken and suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive it was, of a
    hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller, wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have
    remembered home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.</p>
