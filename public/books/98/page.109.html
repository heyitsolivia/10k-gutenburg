    <p>"Oh, for gracious sake!" cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, "record them at once, and get them out of the
    way, like an excellent man."</p>

    <p>"First," said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage, "them poor
    things well out o' this, never no more will I do it, never no more!"</p>

    <p>"I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher," returned Miss Pross, "that you never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg
    you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is."</p>

    <p>"No, miss," returned Jerry, "it shall not be named to you. Second: them poor things well out o' this, and never
    no more will I interfere with Mrs. Cruncher's flopping, never no more!"</p>

    <p>"Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be," said Miss Pross, striving to dry her eyes and compose herself,
    "I have no doubt it is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence.&mdash;O my
    poor darlings!"</p>

    <p>"I go so far as to say, miss, moreover," proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as
    from a pulpit&mdash;"and let my words be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself&mdash;that wot my
    opinions respectin' flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may
    be a flopping at the present time."</p>

    <p>"There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man," cried the distracted Miss Pross, "and I hope she finds it
    answering her expectations."</p>

    <p>"Forbid it," proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity, additional slowness, and additional tendency to
    hold forth and hold out, "as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them
    poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn't all flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get 'em out o' this here
    dismal risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-<em>bid</em> it!" This was Mr. Cruncher's conclusion after a protracted
    but vain endeavour to find a better one.</p>

    <p>And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer.</p>

    <p>"If we ever get back to our native land," said Miss Pross, "you may rely upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as
    I may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events you may be sure
    that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My
    esteemed Mr. Cruncher, let us think!"</p>

    <p>Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer.</p>

    <p>"If you were to go before," said Miss Pross, "and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here, and were to wait
    somewhere for me; wouldn't that be best?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.</p>

    <p>"Where could you wait for me?" asked Miss Pross.</p>

    <p>Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds
    of miles away, and Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed.</p>

    <p>"By the cathedral door," said Miss Pross. "Would it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great
    cathedral door between the two towers?"</p>

    <p>"No, miss," answered Mr. Cruncher.</p>

    <p>"Then, like the best of men," said Miss Pross, "go to the posting-house straight, and make that change."</p>

    <p>"I am doubtful," said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head, "about leaving of you, you see. We don't
    know what may happen."</p>

    <p>"Heaven knows we don't," returned Miss Pross, "but have no fear for me. Take me in at the cathedral, at Three
    o'Clock, or as near it as you can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain of it.
    There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives that may depend on both of us!"</p>

    <p>This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an
    encouraging nod or two, he immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself to follow as she
    had proposed.</p>

    <p>The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross.
    The necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another
    relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at
    once.</p>

    <p>Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping
    from behind every open door in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes, which were
    swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute
    at a time by the dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her.
    In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.</p>

    <p>The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways,
    and through much staining blood, those feet had come to meet that water.</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, "The wife of Evremonde; where is she?"</p>

    <p>It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open, and would suggest the flight. Her first
    act was to shut them. There were four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before the door of
    the chamber which Lucie had occupied.</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement, and rested on her when it was finished. Miss
    Pross had nothing beautiful about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness, of her
    appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes,
    every inch.</p>

    <p>"You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer," said Miss Pross, in her breathing. "Nevertheless, you
    shall not get the better of me. I am an Englishwoman."</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of Miss Pross's own perception that they two
    were at bay. She saw a tight, hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a
    strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross
    knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy.</p>

    <p>"On my way yonder," said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot, "where they
    reserve my chair and my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I wish to see
    her."</p>

    <p>"I know that your intentions are evil," said Miss Pross, "and you may depend upon it, I'll hold my own against
    them."</p>

    <p>Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other's words; both were very watchful, and intent to
    deduce from look and manner, what the unintelligible words meant.</p>
