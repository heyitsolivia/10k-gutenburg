    <p>"Do you seek any promise from me?"</p>

    <p>"I do seek that."</p>

    <p>"What is it?"</p>

    <p>"I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well understand that, even if Miss Manette held me
    at this moment in her innocent heart&mdash;do not think I have the presumption to assume so much&mdash;I could
    retain no place in it against her love for her father."</p>

    <p>"If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?"</p>

    <p>"I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor's favour, would outweigh herself and all
    the world. For which reason, Doctor Manette," said Darnay, modestly but firmly, "I would not ask that word, to save
    my life."</p>

    <p>"I am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the
    former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one respect,
    such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her heart."</p>

    <p>"May I ask, sir, if you think she is&mdash;" As he hesitated, her father supplied the rest.</p>

    <p>"Is sought by any other suitor?"</p>

    <p>"It is what I meant to say."</p>

    <p>Her father considered a little before he answered:</p>

    <p>"You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too, occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be
    by one of these."</p>

    <p>"Or both," said Darnay.</p>

    <p>"I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want a promise from me. Tell me what it
    is."</p>

    <p>"It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own part, such a confidence as I have
    ventured to lay before you, you will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you may be
    able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is
    what I ask. The condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to require, I will observe
    immediately."</p>

    <p>"I give the promise," said the Doctor, "without any condition. I believe your object to be, purely and
    truthfully, as you have stated it. I believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties between me
    and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will
    give her to you. If there were&mdash;Charles Darnay, if there were&mdash;"</p>

    <p>The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke:</p>

    <p>"&mdash;any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really
    loved&mdash;the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head&mdash;they should all be obliterated for her
    sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me than wrong, more to me&mdash;Well! This is idle
    talk."</p>

    <p>So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak,
    that Darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.</p>

    <p>"You said something to me," said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile. "What was it you said to me?"</p>

    <p>He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a condition. Relieved as his mind reverted
    to that, he answered:</p>

    <p>"Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part. My present name, though but slightly
    changed from my mother's, is not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and why I am in
    England."</p>

    <p>"Stop!" said the Doctor of Beauvais.</p>

    <p>"I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no secret from you."</p>

    <p>"Stop!"</p>

    <p>For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for another instant, even had his two hands laid
    on Darnay's lips.</p>

    <p>"Tell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if Lucie should love you, you shall tell me on
    your marriage morning. Do you promise?"</p>

    <p>"Willingly.</p>

    <p>"Give me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she should not see us together to-night. Go! God
    bless you!"</p>

    <p>It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and darker when Lucie came home; she hurried
    into the room alone&mdash;for Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs&mdash;and was surprised to find his
    reading-chair empty.</p>

    <p>"My father!" she called to him. "Father dear!"</p>

    <p>Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom. Passing lightly across the
    intermediate room, she looked in at his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her blood all
    chilled, "What shall I do! What shall I do!"</p>

    <p>Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at his door, and softly called to him. The
    noise ceased at the sound of her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down together for a
    long time.</p>

    <p>She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night. He slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking
    tools, and his old unfinished work, were all as usual.</p>

    <p>"Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his jackal; "mix another bowl of punch; I
    have something to say to you."</p>

    <p>Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before, and the night before that, and a good many
    nights in succession, making a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver's papers before the setting in of the long
    vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid
    of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and bring grist to the mill again.</p>

    <p>Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application. It had taken a deal of extra
    wet-towelling to pull him through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling;
    and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had
    steeped it at intervals for the last six hours.</p>

    <p>"Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?" said Stryver the portly, with his hands in his waistband, glancing
    round from the sofa where he lay on his back.</p>

    <p>"I am."</p>

    <p>"Now, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather surprise you, and that perhaps will make you
    think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry."</p>

    <p>"<em>Do</em> you?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. And not for money. What do you say now?"</p>

    <p>"I don't feel disposed to say much. Who is she?"</p>

    <p>"Guess."</p>

    <p>"Do I know her?"</p>
