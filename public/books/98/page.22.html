    <p>Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his fingers in his following of the evidence. He
    had now to attend while Mr. Stryver fitted the prisoner's case on the jury, like a compact suit of clothes; showing
    them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the
    greatest scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas&mdash;which he certainly did look rather like. How the virtuous
    servant, Cly, was his friend and partner, and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false
    swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family affairs in France, he being of French
    extraction, did require his making those passages across the Channel&mdash;though what those affairs were, a
    consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him, even for his life, to disclose. How the
    evidence that had been warped and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they had witnessed, came
    to nothing, involving the mere little innocent gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young
    gentleman and young lady so thrown together;&mdash;with the exception of that reference to George Washington, which
    was altogether too extravagant and impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke. How it
    would be a weakness in the government to break down in this attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest
    national antipathies and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it; how, nevertheless, it
    rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of
    which the State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed (with as grave a face as if it had
    not been true), saying that he could not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.</p>

    <p>Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned
    the whole suit of clothes Mr. Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and Cly were even a
    hundred times better than he had thought them, and the prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself,
    turning the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them
    into grave-clothes for the prisoner.</p>

    <p>And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.</p>

    <p>Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court, changed neither his place nor his attitude,
    even in this excitement. While his learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him, whispered with those
    who sat near, and from time to time glanced anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and
    grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat, and slowly paced up and down his platform,
    not unattended by a suspicion in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man sat leaning
    back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put on just as it had happened to light on his head after its
    removal, his hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day. Something especially
    reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he
    undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness, when they were compared together, had
    strengthened), that many of the lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would hardly have
    thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the observation to his next neighbour, and added, "I'd hold half a
    guinea that <em>he</em> don't get no law-work to do. Don't look like the sort of one to get any, do he?"</p>

    <p>Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he appeared to take in; for now, when Miss
    Manette's head dropped upon her father's breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly: "Officer! look to
    that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out. Don't you see she will fall!"</p>

    <p>There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much sympathy with her father. It had evidently been
    a great distress to him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown strong internal agitation when
    he was questioned, and that pondering or brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud,
    ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a moment, spoke, through their foreman.</p>

    <p>They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George Washington on his mind) showed some
    surprise that they were not agreed, but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward, and
    retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in the court were now being lighted. It began to be
    rumoured that the jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get refreshment, and the prisoner
    withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat down.</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out, now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry:
    who, in the slackened interest, could easily get near him.</p>

    <p>"Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in the way. You will be sure to hear when the
    jury come in. Don't be a moment behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You are the
    quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long before I can."</p>

    <p>Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a
    shilling. Mr. Carton came up at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.</p>

    <p>"How is the young lady?"</p>

    <p>"She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she feels the better for being out of
    court."</p>

    <p>"I'll tell the prisoner so. It won't do for a respectable bank gentleman like you, to be seen speaking to him
    publicly, you know."</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way
    to the outside of the bar. The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all eyes, ears, and
    spikes.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Darnay!"</p>

    <p>The prisoner came forward directly.</p>

    <p>"You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. She will do very well. You have seen the
    worst of her agitation."</p>

    <p>"I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her so for me, with my fervent
    acknowledgments?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I could. I will, if you ask it."</p>

    <p>Mr. Carton's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He stood, half turned from the prisoner, lounging
    with his elbow against the bar.</p>
