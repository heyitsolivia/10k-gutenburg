    <p>They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was
    expected back presently from the Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in a corner,
    that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through
    his arm: and he, in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of a great and powerful Fairy
    who had opened a prison-wall and let out a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and quiet,
    and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.</p>

    <p>"What is that?" she cried, all at once.</p>

    <p>"My dear!" said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand on hers, "command yourself. What a
    disordered state you are in! The least thing&mdash;nothing&mdash;startles you! <em>You</em>, your father's
    daughter!"</p>

    <p>"I thought, my father," said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face and in a faltering voice, "that I heard
    strange feet upon the stairs."</p>

    <p>"My love, the staircase is as still as Death."</p>

    <p>As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.</p>

    <p>"Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!"</p>

    <p>"My child," said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her shoulder, "I <em>have</em> saved him. What
    weakness is this, my dear! Let me go to the door."</p>

    <p>He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms, and opened it. A rude clattering of feet
    over the floor, and four rough men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.</p>

    <p>"The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay," said the first.</p>

    <p>"Who seeks him?" answered Darnay.</p>

    <p>"I seek him. We seek him. I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the Tribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner
    of the Republic."</p>

    <p>The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him.</p>

    <p>"Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?"</p>

    <p>"It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will know to-morrow. You are summoned for
    to-morrow."</p>

    <p>Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he stood with the lamp in his hand, as if be
    woe a statue made to hold it, moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting the speaker,
    and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red woollen shirt, said:</p>

    <p>"You know him, you have said. Do you know me?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor."</p>

    <p>"We all know you, Citizen Doctor," said the other three.</p>

    <p>He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice, after a pause:</p>

    <p>"Will you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?"</p>

    <p>"Citizen Doctor," said the first, reluctantly, "he has been denounced to the Section of Saint Antoine. This
    citizen," pointing out the second who had entered, "is from Saint Antoine."</p>

    <p>The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:</p>

    <p>"He is accused by Saint Antoine."</p>

    <p>"Of what?" asked the Doctor.</p>

    <p>"Citizen Doctor," said the first, with his former reluctance, "ask no more. If the Republic demands sacrifices
    from you, without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before all. The People
    is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed."</p>

    <p>"One word," the Doctor entreated. "Will you tell me who denounced him?"</p>

    <p>"It is against rule," answered the first; "but you can ask Him of Saint Antoine here."</p>

    <p>The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on his feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at
    length said:</p>

    <p>"Well! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced&mdash;and gravely&mdash;by the Citizen and Citizeness
    Defarge. And by one other."</p>

    <p>"What other?"</p>

    <p>"Do <em>you</em> ask, Citizen Doctor?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"Then," said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, "you will be answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!"</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">VIII. A Hand at Cards</h2>
    <p>Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed
    the river by the bridge of the Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to
    make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. They both looked to the right and to the left into most of
    the shops they passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and turned out of their road to
    avoid any very excited group of talkers. It was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing
    lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked, making
    guns for the Army of the Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with <em>that</em> Army, or got undeserved
    promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.</p>

    <p>Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself
    of the wine they wanted. After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the Good Republican
    Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace, once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things
    rather took her fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed, and,
    though red with patriotic caps, was not so red as the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her opinion,
    Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, attended by her cavalier.</p>

    <p>Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth, playing with limp cards and yellow
    dominoes; of the one bare-breasted, bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of the others
    listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward
    asleep, who in the popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude, like slumbering bears or
    dogs; the two outlandish customers approached the counter, and showed what they wanted.</p>

    <p>As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had
    to face Miss Pross. No sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped her hands.</p>

    <p>In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a
    difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only saw a man and a
    woman standing staring at each other; the man with all the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican;
    the woman, evidently English.</p>
