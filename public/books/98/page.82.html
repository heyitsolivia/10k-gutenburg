    <h2 class="chapter-break">V. The Wood-Sawyer</h2>
    <p>One year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine
    would strike off her husband's head next day. Every day, through the stony streets, the tumbrils now jolted heavily,
    filled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and
    old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all daily brought into light from the dark
    cellars of the loathsome prisons, and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst. Liberty,
    equality, fraternity, or death;&mdash;the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!</p>

    <p>If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time, had stunned the Doctor's daughter into
    awaiting the result in idle despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. But, from the hour when
    she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her
    duties. She was truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good will always be.</p>

    <p>As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father had entered on the routine of his
    avocations, she arranged the little household as exactly as if her husband had been there. Everything had its
    appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she taught, as regularly, as if they had all been united in
    their English home. The slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that they would soon
    be reunited&mdash;the little preparations for his speedy return, the setting aside of his chair and his
    books&mdash;these, and the solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many unhappy souls in
    prison and the shadow of death&mdash;were almost the only outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.</p>

    <p>She did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin to mourning dresses, which she and her
    child wore, were as neat and as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her colour, and the
    old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional, thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely.
    Sometimes, at night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had repressed all day, and would say
    that her sole reliance, under Heaven, was on him. He always resolutely answered: "Nothing can happen to him without
    my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie."</p>

    <p>They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her father said to her, on coming home one
    evening:</p>

    <p>"My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can sometimes gain access at three in the
    afternoon. When he can get to it&mdash;which depends on many uncertainties and incidents&mdash;he might see you in
    the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can show you. But you will not be able to see him, my
    poor child, and even if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition."</p>

    <p>"O show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day."</p>

    <p>From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the clock struck two, she was there, and at four
    she turned resignedly away. When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they went together;
    at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a single day.</p>

    <p>It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for
    burning, was the only house at that end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed
    her.</p>

    <p>"Good day, citizeness."</p>

    <p>"Good day, citizen."</p>

    <p>This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been established voluntarily some time ago, among the
    more thorough patriots; but, was now law for everybody.</p>

    <p>"Walking here again, citizeness?"</p>

    <p>"You see me, citizen!"</p>

    <p>The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he had once been a mender of roads), cast a
    glance at the prison, pointed at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars, peeped
    through them jocosely.</p>

    <p>"But it's not my business," said he. And went on sawing his wood.</p>

    <p>Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she appeared.</p>

    <p>"What? Walking here again, citizeness?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, citizen."</p>

    <p>"Ah! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?"</p>

    <p>"Do I say yes, mamma?" whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her.</p>

    <p>"Yes, dearest."</p>

    <p>"Yes, citizen."</p>

    <p>"Ah! But it's not my business. My work is my business. See my saw! I call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la;
    La, la, la! And off his head comes!"</p>

    <p>The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.</p>

    <p>"I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. See here again! Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off
    <em>her</em> head comes! Now, a child. Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off <em>its</em> head comes. All the
    family!"</p>

    <p>Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was impossible to be there while the
    wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke to him
    first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.</p>

    <p>He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and
    grates, and in lifting her heart up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her, with his
    knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. "But it's not my business!" he would generally say at those
    times, and would briskly fall to his sawing again.</p>

    <p>In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of spring, in the hot sunshine of summer,
    in the rains of autumn, and again in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at this
    place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall. Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father)
    it might be once in five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not for a week or a
    fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she
    would have waited out the day, seven days a week.</p>

    <p>These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her father walked among the terrors with a
    steady head. On a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a day of some wild rejoicing,
    and a festival. She had seen the houses, as she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps
    stuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription (tricoloured letters were the
    favourite), Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!</p>
