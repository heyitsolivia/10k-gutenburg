    <p>Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr. Stryver was lying back on his sofa, winking at
    his ceiling.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">XIII. The Fellow of No Delicacy</h2>
    <p>If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the house of Doctor Manette. He had been there
    often, during a whole year, and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he cared to talk, he
    talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing, which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very
    rarely pierced by the light within him.</p>

    <p>And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house, and for the senseless stones that made
    their pavements. Many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no transitory gladness
    to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the
    first beams of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty
    buildings, as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable, into his
    mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him more scantily than ever; and often when he had
    thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that neighbourhood.</p>

    <p>On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal that "he had thought better of that marrying
    matter") had carried his delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the City streets had
    some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney's
    feet still trod those stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became animated by an intention, and,
    in the working out of that intention, they took him to the Doctor's door.</p>

    <p>He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had never been quite at her ease with him, and
    received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at his face in the
    interchange of the first few common-places, she observed a change in it.</p>

    <p>"I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!"</p>

    <p>"No. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. What is to be expected of, or by, such
    profligates?"</p>

    <p>"Is it not&mdash;forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips&mdash;a pity to live no better life?"</p>

    <p>"God knows it is a shame!"</p>

    <p>"Then why not change it?"</p>

    <p>Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes. There were
    tears in his voice too, as he answered:</p>

    <p>"It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall sink lower, and be worse."</p>

    <p>He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. The table trembled in the silence that
    followed.</p>

    <p>She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to be so, without looking at her, and
    said:</p>

    <p>"Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge of what I want to say to you. Will you hear
    me?"</p>

    <p>"If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier, it would make me very glad!"</p>

    <p>"God bless you for your sweet compassion!"</p>

    <p>He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.</p>

    <p>"Don't be afraid to hear me. Don't shrink from anything I say. I am like one who died young. All my life might
    have been."</p>

    <p>"No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am sure that you might be much, much
    worthier of yourself."</p>

    <p>"Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better&mdash;although in the mystery of my own wretched heart I
    know better&mdash;I shall never forget it!"</p>

    <p>She was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike
    any other that could have been holden.</p>

    <p>"If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the love of the man you see before
    yourself&mdash;flung away, wasted, drunken, poor creature of misuse as you know him to be&mdash;he would have been
    conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and
    repentance, blight you, disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you can have no tenderness for
    me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot be."</p>

    <p>"Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall you&mdash;forgive me again!&mdash;to a better
    course? Can I in no way repay your confidence? I know this is a confidence," she modestly said, after a little
    hesitation, and in earnest tears, "I know you would say this to no one else. Can I turn it to no good account for
    yourself, Mr. Carton?"</p>

    <p>He shook his head.</p>

    <p>"To none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a very little more, all you can ever do for me
    is done. I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not been so
    degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this home made such a home by you, has stirred old
    shadows that I thought had died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that I thought would
    never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for
    ever. I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off sloth and sensuality, and fighting
    out the abandoned fight. A dream, all a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down, but I
    wish you to know that you inspired it."</p>

    <p>"Will nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!"</p>

    <p>"No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness,
    and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am,
    into fire&mdash;a fire, however, inseparable in its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing
    no service, idly burning away."</p>

    <p>"Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew
    me&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Don't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if anything could. You will not be the cause of
    my becoming worse."</p>

    <p>"Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events, attributable to some influence of
    mine&mdash;this is what I mean, if I can make it plain&mdash;can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power
    for good, with you, at all?"</p>
