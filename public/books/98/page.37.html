    <p>"And you?" said the uncle. "Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new philosophy, graciously intend to
    live?"</p>

    <p>"I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at their backs, may have to do some
    day&mdash;work."</p>

    <p>"In England, for example?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The family name can suffer from me in no other,
    for I bear it in no other."</p>

    <p>The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be lighted. It now shone brightly, through the
    door of communication. The Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his valet.</p>

    <p>"England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have prospered there," he observed then, turning
    his calm face to his nephew with a smile.</p>

    <p>"I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it
    is my Refuge."</p>

    <p>"They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You know a compatriot who has found a Refuge
    there? A Doctor?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"With a daughter?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"Yes," said the Marquis. "You are fatigued. Good night!"</p>

    <p>As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air
    of mystery to those words, which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same time, the thin
    straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a
    sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic.</p>

    <p>"Yes," repeated the Marquis. "A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued.
    Good night!"</p>

    <p>It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face
    of his. The nephew looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.</p>

    <p>"Good night!" said the uncle. "I look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning. Good repose! Light
    Monsieur my nephew to his chamber there!&mdash;And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will," he added to
    himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his valet to his own bedroom.</p>

    <p>The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself
    gently for sleep, that hot still night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no noise on the
    floor, he moved like a refined tiger:&mdash;looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in
    story, whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just coming on.</p>

    <p>He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the scraps of the day's journey that came
    unbidden into his mind; the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the prison on
    the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap
    pointing out the chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain, the little bundle lying on
    the step, the women bending over it, and the tall man with his arms up, crying, "Dead!"</p>

    <p>"I am cool now," said Monsieur the Marquis, "and may go to bed."</p>

    <p>So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin gauze curtains fall around him, and heard
    the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.</p>

    <p>The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours; for three heavy
    hours, the horses in the stables rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with very little
    resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of
    such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them.</p>

    <p>For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human, stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness
    lay on all the landscape, dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads. The burial-place
    had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the
    Cross might have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village, taxers and taxed were fast
    asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and the
    yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and freed.</p>

    <p>The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and
    unheard&mdash;both melting away, like the minutes that were falling from the spring of Time&mdash;through three dark
    hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light, and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau
    were opened.</p>

    <p>Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees, and poured its radiance over the
    hill. In the glow, the water of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces crimsoned. The
    carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of
    Monsieur the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might. At this, the nearest stone face
    seemed to stare amazed, and, with open mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.</p>

    <p>Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred,
    and people came forth shivering&mdash;chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely lightened toil of
    the day among the village population. Some, to the fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and
    delve; men and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows out, to such pasture as could be
    found by the roadside. In the church and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter prayers,
    the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot.</p>

    <p>The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and
    knives of the chase had been reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine; now, doors and
    windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness
    pouring in at doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs pulled hard at their chains, and
    reared impatient to be loosed.</p>

    <p>All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the return of morning. Surely, not so the
    ringing of the great bell of the chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried figures on the
    terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding
    away?</p>
