    <p>Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his
    back; dragged, and struck at, and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by
    hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of
    vehement agony of action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might
    see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of
    the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go&mdash;as a cat might have done to a mouse&mdash;and
    silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately
    screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he
    went aloft, and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope broke, and they
    caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass
    enough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.</p>

    <p>Nor was this the end of the day's bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up, that it
    boiled again, on hearing when the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the people's
    enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine
    wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper, seized him&mdash;would have torn him out of the breast of an army to
    bear Foulon company&mdash;set his head and heart on pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in
    Wolf-procession through the streets.</p>

    <p>Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children, wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable
    bakers' shops were beset by long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while they waited with
    stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving
    them again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away; and then poor lights
    began to shine in high windows, and slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in common,
    afterwards supping at their doors.</p>

    <p>Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human
    fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them.
    Fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;
    and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and hoped.</p>

    <p>It was almost morning, when Defarge's wine-shop parted with its last knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said
    to madame his wife, in husky tones, while fastening the door:</p>

    <p>"At last it is come, my dear!"</p>

    <p>"Eh well!" returned madame. "Almost."</p>

    <p>Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with her starved grocer, and the drum was at
    rest. The drum's was the only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The Vengeance, as
    custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or
    old Foulon was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint Antoine's bosom.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">XXIII. Fire Rises</h2>
    <p>There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the mender of roads went forth daily to
    hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant
    soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers
    to guard it, but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of them knew what his men would
    do&mdash;beyond this: that it would probably not be what he was ordered.</p>

    <p>Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation. Every green leaf, every blade of grass and
    blade of grain, was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down, dejected, oppressed,
    and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them&mdash;all
    worn out.</p>

    <p>Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things,
    was a polite example of luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose; nevertheless,
    Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought things to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for
    Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must be something short-sighted in the eternal
    arrangements, surely! Thus it was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints, and
    the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with
    nothing to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable.</p>

    <p>But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like it. For scores of years gone by,
    Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the
    chase&mdash;now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur
    made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces
    of low caste, rather than in the disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and
    beautifying features of Monseigneur.</p>

    <p>For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the dust, not often troubling himself to reflect
    that dust he was and to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had
    for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it&mdash;in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely
    labour, and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on foot, the like of which was once a
    rarity in those parts, but was now a frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern without
    surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even
    to the eyes of a mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many highways, dank with the
    marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through
    woods.</p>
