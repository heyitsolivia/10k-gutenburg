    <p>"Don't despond," said Carton, very gently; "don't grieve. I encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I
    felt that it might one day be consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think 'his life was wantonly thrown away or
    wasted,' and that might trouble her."</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes, yes," returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, "you are right. But he will perish; there is no real
    hope."</p>

    <p>"Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope," echoed Carton.</p>

    <p>And walked with a settled step, down-stairs.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">XII. Darkness</h2>
    <p>Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. "At Tellson's banking-house at nine," he said,
    with a musing face. "Shall I do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that these people
    should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care,
    care, care! Let me think it out!"</p>

    <p>Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a turn or two in the already darkening
    street, and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression was confirmed. "It is
    best," he said, finally resolved, "that these people should know there is such a man as I here." And he turned his
    face towards Saint Antoine.</p>

    <p>Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not
    difficult for one who knew the city well, to find his house without asking any question. Having ascertained its
    situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep
    after dinner. For the first time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night he had taken nothing but a
    little light thin wine, and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry's hearth like a man who
    had done with it.</p>

    <p>It was as late as seven o'clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out into the streets again. As he passed along
    towards Saint Antoine, he stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered the disordered
    arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge's,
    and went in.</p>

    <p>There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the restless fingers and the croaking voice.
    This man, whom he had seen upon the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the Defarges,
    man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like a regular member of the establishment.</p>

    <p>As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent French) for a small measure of wine, Madame
    Defarge cast a careless glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced to him herself, and
    asked him what it was he had ordered.</p>

    <p>He repeated what he had already said.</p>

    <p>"English?" asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows.</p>

    <p>After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were slow to express itself to him, he
    answered, in his former strong foreign accent. "Yes, madame, yes. I am English!"</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore
    over it puzzling out its meaning, he heard her say, "I swear to you, like Evremonde!"</p>

    <p>Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.</p>

    <p>"How?"</p>

    <p>"Good evening."</p>

    <p>"Oh! Good evening, citizen," filling his glass. "Ah! and good wine. I drink to the Republic."</p>

    <p>Defarge went back to the counter, and said, "Certainly, a little like." Madame sternly retorted, "I tell you a
    good deal like." Jacques Three pacifically remarked, "He is so much in your mind, see you, madame." The amiable
    Vengeance added, with a laugh, "Yes, my faith! And you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once
    more to-morrow!"</p>

    <p>Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face.
    They were all leaning their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence of a few moments,
    during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they
    resumed their conversation.</p>

    <p>"It is true what madame says," observed Jacques Three. "Why stop? There is great force in that. Why stop?"</p>

    <p>"Well, well," reasoned Defarge, "but one must stop somewhere. After all, the question is still where?"</p>

    <p>"At extermination," said madame.</p>

    <p>"Magnificent!" croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly approved.</p>

    <p>"Extermination is good doctrine, my wife," said Defarge, rather troubled; "in general, I say nothing against it.
    But this Doctor has suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when the paper was
    read."</p>

    <p>"I have observed his face!" repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily. "Yes. I have observed his face. I have
    observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his face!"</p>

    <p>"And you have observed, my wife," said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner, "the anguish of his daughter, which must
    be a dreadful anguish to him!"</p>

    <p>"I have observed his daughter," repeated madame; "yes, I have observed his daughter, more times than one. I have
    observed her to-day, and I have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court, and I have observed her
    in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my finger&mdash;!" She seemed to raise it (the listener's eyes were
    always on his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as if the axe had dropped.</p>

    <p>"The citizeness is superb!" croaked the Juryman.</p>

    <p>"She is an Angel!" said The Vengeance, and embraced her.</p>

    <p>"As to thee," pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, "if it depended on thee&mdash;which, happily,
    it does not&mdash;thou wouldst rescue this man even now."</p>

    <p>"No!" protested Defarge. "Not if to lift this glass would do it! But I would leave the matter there. I say, stop
    there."</p>

    <p>"See you then, Jacques," said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; "and see you, too, my little Vengeance; see you both!
    Listen! For other crimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register, doomed to
    destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so."</p>

    <p>"It is so," assented Defarge, without being asked.</p>

    <p>"In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds this paper of to-day, and he brings it
    home, and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot, by the light
    of this lamp. Ask him, is that so."</p>
