    <p>The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away through the village, and galloped up the
    stony steep, to the prison on the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire; removed from
    them, a group of soldiers. "Help, gentlemen&mdash;officers! The chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved
    from the flames by timely aid! Help, help!" The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire; gave no
    orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting of lips, "It must burn."</p>

    <p>As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the village was illuminating. The mender of
    roads, and the two hundred and fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up,
    had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of
    everything, occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of
    reluctance and hesitation on that functionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority, had
    remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with, and that post-horses would roast.</p>

    <p>The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind,
    driving straight from the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising and falling of
    the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face
    with the two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke again, as if it were the face of the
    cruel Marquis, burning at the stake and contending with the fire.</p>

    <p>The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire, scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance,
    fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten lead and iron boiled
    in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before
    the heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls,
    like crystallisation; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures trudged away,
    East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their
    next destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for
    joy.</p>

    <p>Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that
    Monsieur Gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes&mdash;though it was but a small instalment of
    taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter days&mdash;became impatient for an interview with
    him, and, surrounding his house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon, Monsieur Gabelle did
    heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again
    withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time resolved, if his door were broken in (he
    was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet, and crush a
    man or two below.</p>

    <p>Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the distant chateau for fire and candle, and the
    beating at his door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slung
    across the road before his posting-house gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his
    favour. A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that
    plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the
    rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed, and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his
    life with him for that while.</p>

    <p>Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were other functionaries less fortunate, that
    night and other nights, whom the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they had been born and
    bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon
    whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up in their turn. But, the fierce
    figures were steadily wending East, West, North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.
    The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it, no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics,
    was able to calculate successfully.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">XXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock</h2>
    <p>In such risings of fire and risings of sea&mdash;the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had
    now no ebb, but was always on the flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the
    shore&mdash;three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven by the golden
    thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home.</p>

    <p>Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner, with hearts that failed them
    when they heard the thronging feet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people,
    tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible
    enchantment long persisted in.</p>

    <p>Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated: of his being
    so little wanted in France, as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and this life
    together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him
    that he could ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after boldly reading the Lord's
    Prayer backwards for a great number of years, and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One,
    no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.</p>

    <p>The shining Bull's Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets.
    It had never been a good eye to see with&mdash;had long had the mote in it of Lucifer's pride, Sardanapalus's
    luxury, and a mole's blindness&mdash;but it had dropped out and was gone. The Court, from that exclusive inner
    circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was all gone together. Royalty was
    gone; had been besieged in its Palace and "suspended," when the last tidings came over.</p>
