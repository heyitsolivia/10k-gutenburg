    <p>He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in
    his life.</p>

    <p>"I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me;
    we do it, and we know it, with our eyes. 'Come on!' says the chief of that company, pointing to the village, 'bring
    him fast to his tomb!' and they bring him faster. I follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight,
    his wooden shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and consequently slow, they drive him
    with their guns&mdash;like this!"</p>

    <p>He imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the butt-ends of muskets.</p>

    <p>"As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They laugh and pick him up again. His face is
    bleeding and covered with dust, but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into the village;
    all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill, and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison
    gate open in the darkness of the night, and swallow him&mdash;like this!"</p>

    <p>He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth. Observant of his
    unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again, Defarge said, "Go on, Jacques."</p>

    <p>"All the village," pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low voice, "withdraws; all the village
    whispers by the fountain; all the village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the locks and
    bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it, except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my
    shoulder, eating my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on my way to my work. There I see
    him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no hand
    free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a dead man."</p>

    <p>Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all of them were dark, repressed, and
    revengeful, as they listened to the countryman's story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was
    authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each
    with his chin resting on his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally intent, on one
    knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose;
    Defarge standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the light of the window, by turns looking
    from him to them, and from them to him.</p>

    <p>"Go on, Jacques," said Defarge.</p>

    <p>"He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it
    always looks up, from a distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work of the day is
    achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were
    turned towards the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They whisper at the fountain, that
    although condemned to death he will not be executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing
    that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say that a petition has been presented to the King
    himself. What do I know? It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no."</p>

    <p>"Listen then, Jacques," Number One of that name sternly interposed. "Know that a petition was presented to the
    King and Queen. All here, yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street, sitting beside the
    Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the
    petition in his hand."</p>

    <p>"And once again listen, Jacques!" said the kneeling Number Three: his fingers ever wandering over and over those
    fine nerves, with a strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something&mdash;that was neither food nor drink;
    "the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner, and struck him blows. You hear?"</p>

    <p>"I hear, messieurs."</p>

    <p>"Go on then," said Defarge.</p>

    <p>"Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain," resumed the countryman, "that he is brought down into
    our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper that because
    he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the father of his tenants&mdash;serfs&mdash;what you
    will&mdash;he will be executed as a parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed with the
    knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his
    legs, there will be poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally, that he will be torn limb
    from limb by four strong horses. That old man says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on
    the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies? I am not a scholar."</p>

    <p>"Listen once again then, Jacques!" said the man with the restless hand and the craving air. "The name of that
    prisoner was Damiens, and it was all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and nothing was
    more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full
    of eager attention to the last&mdash;to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall, when he had lost two legs and
    an arm, and still breathed! And it was done&mdash;why, how old are you?"</p>

    <p>"Thirty-five," said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.</p>

    <p>"It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen it."</p>

    <p>"Enough!" said Defarge, with grim impatience. "Long live the Devil! Go on."</p>

    <p>"Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else; even the fountain appears to fall to
    that tune. At length, on Sunday night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from the prison,
    and their guns ring on the stones of the little street. Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the
    morning, by the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the water."</p>

    <p>The mender of roads looked <em>through</em> rather than <em>at</em> the low ceiling, and pointed as if he saw the
    gallows somewhere in the sky.</p>

    <p>"All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out, the cows are there with the rest. At midday,
    the roll of drums. Soldiers have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst of many soldiers. He
    is bound as before, and in his mouth there is a gag&mdash;tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if
    he laughed." He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs, from the corners of his mouth to his ears.
    "On the top of the gallows is fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged there forty
    feet high&mdash;and is left hanging, poisoning the water."</p>
