    <p>"Well! And hallo you!" said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.</p>

    <p>"Come on at a footpace! d'ye mind me? And if you've got holsters to that saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your
    hand go nigh 'em. For I'm a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So now let's
    look at you."</p>

    <p>The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist, and came to the side of the mail, where
    the passenger stood. The rider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger a small folded
    paper. The rider's horse was blown, and both horse and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to
    the hat of the man.</p>

    <p>"Guard!" said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.</p>

    <p>The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his
    eye on the horseman, answered curtly, "Sir."</p>

    <p>"There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson's Bank. You must know Tellson's Bank in London. I am going to
    Paris on business. A crown to drink. I may read this?"</p>

    <p>"If so be as you're quick, sir."</p>

    <p>He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and read&mdash;first to himself and then aloud: "'Wait
    at Dover for Mam'selle.' It's not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED TO LIFE."</p>

    <p>Jerry started in his saddle. "That's a Blazing strange answer, too," said he, at his hoarsest.</p>

    <p>"Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as well as if I wrote. Make the best of your
    way. Good night."</p>

    <p>With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers,
    who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general pretence of
    being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action.</p>

    <p>The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent. The guard
    soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and having looked to
    the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt, looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were
    a few smith's tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was furnished with that completeness that if the
    coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut himself up inside,
    keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were
    lucky) in five minutes.</p>

    <p>"Tom!" softly over the coach roof.</p>

    <p>"Hallo, Joe."</p>

    <p>"Did you hear the message?"</p>

    <p>"I did, Joe."</p>

    <p>"What did you make of it, Tom?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing at all, Joe."</p>

    <p>"That's a coincidence, too," the guard mused, "for I made the same of it myself."</p>

    <p>Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe
    the mud from his face, and shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding about half a gallon.
    After standing with the bridle over his heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within
    hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill.</p>

    <p>"After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won't trust your fore-legs till I get you on the level,"
    said this hoarse messenger, glancing at his mare. "'Recalled to life.' That's a Blazing strange message. Much of
    that wouldn't do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You'd be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into
    fashion, Jerry!"</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">III. The Night Shadows</h2>
    <p>A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery
    to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered
    houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating
    heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest
    it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this
    dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this
    unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other
    things submerged. It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read
    but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its
    surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my
    soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that
    individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end. In any of the burial-places of this city through
    which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to
    me, or than I am to them?</p>

    <p>As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the messenger on horseback had exactly the same
    possessions as the King, the first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the three
    passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as
    complete as if each had been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the breadth of a county
    between him and the next.</p>

    <p>The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a
    tendency to keep his own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that assorted very well with
    that decoration, being of a surface black, with no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together&mdash;as
    if they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too far apart. They had a sinister
    expression, under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and
    throat, which descended nearly to the wearer's knees. When he stopped for drink, he moved this muffler with his left
    hand, only while he poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he muffled again.</p>

    <p>"No, Jerry, no!" said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode. "It wouldn't do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you
    honest tradesman, it wouldn't suit <em>your</em> line of business! Recalled&mdash;! Bust me if I don't think he'd been
    a drinking!"</p>
