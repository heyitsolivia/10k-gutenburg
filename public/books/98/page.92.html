    <p>"Ugh!" cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, "I am shocked at the sight of you."</p>

    <p>"Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir," pursued Mr. Cruncher, "even if it wos so, which I don't say it
    is&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Don't prevaricate," said Mr. Lorry.</p>

    <p>"No, I will <em>not</em>, sir," returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were further from his thoughts or
    practice&mdash;"which I don't say it is&mdash;wot I would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there
    stool, at that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to be a man, wot will errand you,
    message you, general-light-job you, till your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. If it wos
    so, which I still don't say it is (for I will not prewaricate to you, sir), let that there boy keep his father's
    place, and take care of his mother; don't blow upon that boy's father&mdash;do not do it, sir&mdash;and let that
    father go into the line of the reg'lar diggin', and make amends for what he would have undug&mdash;if it wos
    so&mdash;by diggin' of 'em in with a will, and with conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of 'em safe. That, Mr.
    Lorry," said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the
    peroration of his discourse, "is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don't see all this here a goin'
    on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down
    to porterage and hardly that, without havin' his serious thoughts of things. And these here would be mine, if it wos
    so, entreatin' of you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good cause when I might
    have kep' it back."</p>

    <p>"That at least is true," said Mr. Lorry. "Say no more now. It may be that I shall yet stand your friend, if you
    deserve it, and repent in action&mdash;not in words. I want no more words."</p>

    <p>Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy returned from the dark room. "Adieu, Mr.
    Barsad," said the former; "our arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me."</p>

    <p>He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he
    had done?</p>

    <p>"Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access to him, once."</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry's countenance fell.</p>

    <p>"It is all I could do," said Carton. "To propose too much, would be to put this man's head under the axe, and, as
    he himself said, nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the weakness of the
    position. There is no help for it."</p>

    <p>"But access to him," said Mr. Lorry, "if it should go ill before the Tribunal, will not save him."</p>

    <p>"I never said it would."</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his darling, and the heavy disappointment of his
    second arrest, gradually weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late, and his tears
    fell.</p>

    <p>"You are a good man and a true friend," said Carton, in an altered voice. "Forgive me if I notice that you are
    affected. I could not see my father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your sorrow more, if you
    were my father. You are free from that misfortune, however."</p>

    <p>Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there was a true feeling and respect both in
    his tone and in his touch, that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly unprepared for. He
    gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.</p>

    <p>"To return to poor Darnay," said Carton. "Don't tell Her of this interview, or this arrangement. It would not
    enable Her to go to see him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey to him the means of
    anticipating the sentence."</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to see if it were in his mind. It seemed to
    be; he returned the look, and evidently understood it.</p>

    <p>"She might think a thousand things," Carton said, "and any of them would only add to her trouble. Don't speak of
    me to her. As I said to you when I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any little
    helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that. You are going to her, I hope? She must be very
    desolate to-night."</p>

    <p>"I am going now, directly."</p>

    <p>"I am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you. How does she look?"</p>

    <p>"Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful."</p>

    <p>"Ah!"</p>

    <p>It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh&mdash;almost like a sob. It attracted Mr. Lorry's eyes to Carton's
    face, which was turned to the fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which), passed from
    it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one
    of the little flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat and top-boots, then in vogue,
    and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair, all
    untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of
    remonstrance from Mr. Lorry; his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had broken under the
    weight of his foot.</p>

    <p>"I forgot it," he said.</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally
    handsome features, and having the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly reminded of that
    expression.</p>

    <p>"And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?" said Carton, turning to him.</p>

    <p>"Yes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do
    here. I hoped to have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have my Leave to Pass. I was
    ready to go."</p>

    <p>They were both silent.</p>

    <p>"Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?" said Carton, wistfully.</p>

    <p>"I am in my seventy-eighth year."</p>

    <p>"You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied; trusted, respected, and looked up
    to?"</p>

    <p>"I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I may say that I was a man of business when
    a boy."</p>

    <p>"See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss you when you leave it empty!"</p>

    <p>"A solitary old bachelor," answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. "There is nobody to weep for me."</p>

    <p>"How can you say that? Wouldn't She weep for you? Wouldn't her child?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes, thank God. I didn't quite mean what I said."</p>

    <p>"It <em>is</em> a thing to thank God for; is it not?"</p>
