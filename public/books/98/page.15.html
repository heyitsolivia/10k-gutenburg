    <p>Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from this little earth that the learned tell us
    it is doubtful whether their rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything is suffered or
    done: the shadows of the night were broad and black. All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they
    once more whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry&mdash;sitting opposite the buried man who had been dug out, and
    wondering what subtle powers were for ever lost to him, and what were capable of restoration&mdash;the old
    inquiry:</p>

    <p>"I hope you care to be recalled to life?"</p>

    <p>And the old answer:</p>

    <p>"I can't say."</p>

    <p>Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty.
    It was very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place, moreover, in the moral
    attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,
    proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an
    express conviction that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was no passive belief,
    but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business. Tellson's (they said) wanted no
    elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no embellishment. Noakes and Co.'s might, or Snooks
    Brothers' might; but Tellson's, thank Heaven&mdash;!</p>

    <p>Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellson's. In this
    respect the House was much on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting
    improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable.</p>

    <p>Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience. After bursting open a
    door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps, and came to your
    senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if
    the wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows, which were always under a
    shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the heavy
    shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing "the House," you were put into a species of
    Condemned Hold at the back, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its hands in its
    pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old
    wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut. Your
    bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among the
    neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into
    extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the
    banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great
    dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the
    first letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released from the horror
    of being ogled through the windows, by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity
    worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.</p>

    <p>But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions, and not
    least of all with Tellson's. Death is Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's? Accordingly, the
    forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to
    Death; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse at Tellson's door, who
    made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of three-fourths of
    the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of
    prevention&mdash;it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse&mdash;but, it
    cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be
    looked after. Thus, Tellson's, in its day, like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many
    lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately disposed of,
    they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.</p>

    <p>Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson's, the oldest of men carried on the business
    gravely. When they took a young man into Tellson's London house, they hid him somewhere till he was old. They kept
    him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he
    permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general
    weight of the establishment.</p>

    <p>Outside Tellson's&mdash;never by any means in it, unless called in&mdash;was an odd-job-man, an occasional porter
    and messenger, who served as the live sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless upon an
    errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin of twelve, who was his express image. People
    understood that Tellson's, in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always tolerated some person
    in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the
    youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he
    had received the added appellation of Jerry.</p>

    <p>The scene was Mr. Cruncher's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley, Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of
    the clock on a windy March morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself always spoke of
    the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from the
    invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)</p>
