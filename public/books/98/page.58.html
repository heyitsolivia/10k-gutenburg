    <p>Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the Doctor's room. The bench was turned towards
    the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was
    very busy.</p>

    <p>"Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!"</p>

    <p>The Doctor looked at him for a moment&mdash;half inquiringly, half as if he were angry at being spoken
    to&mdash;and bent over his work again.</p>

    <p>He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he did that
    work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked
    hard&mdash;impatiently&mdash;as if in some sense of having been interrupted.</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape. He took up
    another that was lying by him, and asked what it was.</p>

    <p>"A young lady's walking shoe," he muttered, without looking up. "It ought to have been finished long ago. Let it
    be."</p>

    <p>"But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!"</p>

    <p>He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in his work.</p>

    <p>"You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper occupation. Think, dear friend!"</p>

    <p>Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so;
    but, no persuasion would extract a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and words fell on
    him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could
    discover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there seemed a faint expression
    of curiosity or perplexity&mdash;as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.</p>

    <p>Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above all others; the first, that this must be
    kept secret from Lucie; the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In conjunction with Miss
    Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and
    required a few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter, Miss Pross was
    to write, describing his having been called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of two or
    three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been addressed to her by the same post.</p>

    <p>These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself. If that
    should happen soon, he kept another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he thought the
    best, on the Doctor's case.</p>

    <p>In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry
    resolved to watch him attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He therefore made arrangements
    to absent himself from Tellson's for the first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same
    room.</p>

    <p>He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him, since, on being pressed, he became
    worried. He abandoned that attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always before him, as a
    silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat
    near the window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of, that
    it was a free place.</p>

    <p>Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on, that first day, until it was too dark to
    see&mdash;worked on, half an hour after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write. When he put
    his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose and said to him:</p>

    <p>"Will you go out?"</p>

    <p>He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner, looked up in the old manner, and repeated in
    the old low voice:</p>

    <p>"Out?"</p>

    <p>"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?"</p>

    <p>He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr. Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward
    on his bench in the dusk, with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in some misty way
    asking himself, "Why not?" The sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold
    it.</p>

    <p>Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room. He
    paced up and down for a long time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he fell asleep. In
    the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his bench and to work.</p>

    <p>On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name, and spoke to him on topics that had been of
    late familiar to them. He returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and that he thought
    about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during
    the day; at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then present, precisely in the usual manner,
    and as if there were nothing amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or often
    enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry's friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he
    appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.</p>

    <p>When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:</p>

    <p>"Dear Doctor, will you go out?"</p>

    <p>As before, he repeated, "Out?"</p>

    <p>"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?"</p>

    <p>This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him, and, after remaining absent for
    an hour, returned. In the meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had sat there looking
    down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he slipped away to his bench.</p>

    <p>The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and his heart grew heavier again, and grew yet
    heavier and heavier every day. The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days, seven days,
    eight days, nine days.</p>

    <p>With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this
    anxious time. The secret was well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to observe that
    the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first, was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been
    so intent on his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in the dusk of the ninth
    evening.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">XIX. An Opinion</h2>
    <p>Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the tenth morning of his suspense, he was
    startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark
    night.</p>
