    <p>The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in the affirmative: seizing the occasion to
    add that he was the most ardent of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans, if
    anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll
    national barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been suspected (perhaps was, by the dark
    eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge's head) of having his small individual fears for his
    own personal safety, every hour in the day.</p>

    <p>"I," said madame, "am equally engaged at the same place. After it is over&mdash;say at eight to-night&mdash;come
    you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we will give information against these people at my Section."</p>

    <p>The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he
    became embarrassed, evaded her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and hid his
    confusion over the handle of his saw.</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to the door, and there expounded her
    further views to them thus:</p>

    <p>"She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She will be mourning and grieving. She will be in a
    state of mind to impeach the justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies. I will go to
    her."</p>

    <p>"What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!" exclaimed Jacques Three, rapturously. "Ah, my cherished!"
    cried The Vengeance; and embraced her.</p>

    <p>"Take you my knitting," said Madame Defarge, placing it in her lieutenant's hands, "and have it ready for me in
    my usual seat. Keep me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a greater concourse than
    usual, to-day."</p>

    <p>"I willingly obey the orders of my Chief," said The Vengeance with alacrity, and kissing her cheek. "You will not
    be late?"</p>

    <p>"I shall be there before the commencement."</p>

    <p>"And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul," said The Vengeance, calling after her, for she
    had already turned into the street, "before the tumbrils arrive!"</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and might be relied upon to arrive in good time,
    and so went through the mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the Juryman, looking after
    her as she walked away, were highly appreciative of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.</p>

    <p>There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one
    among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a strong and
    fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only
    seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of
    those qualities; the troubled time would have heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood
    with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress.
    She was absolutely without pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of her.</p>

    <p>It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but
    them. It was nothing to her, that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient
    punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her,
    was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had been laid low in the streets, in any
    of the many encounters in which she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had been
    ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change
    places with the man who sent her there.</p>

    <p>Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a
    certain weird way, and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her bosom, was a loaded
    pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of
    such a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and
    bare-legged, on the brown sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.</p>

    <p>Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load, had
    been planned out last night, the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's attention. It
    was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach, but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied
    in examining it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their escape might depend on the saving
    of only a few seconds here and there. Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross and
    Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at three o'clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance
    known to that period. Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and, passing it and preceding
    it on the road, would order its horses in advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of
    the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.</p>

    <p>Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it
    with joy. She and Jerry had beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had passed some ten
    minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame
    Defarge, taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they
    held their consultation.</p>

    <p>"Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher," said Miss Pross, whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak,
    or stand, or move, or live: "what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another carriage having
    already gone from here to-day, it might awaken suspicion."</p>

    <p>"My opinion, miss," returned Mr. Cruncher, "is as you're right. Likewise wot I'll stand by you, right or
    wrong."</p>

    <p>"I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures," said Miss Pross, wildly crying, "that I am
    incapable of forming any plan. Are <em>you</em> capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?"</p>

    <p>"Respectin' a future spear o' life, miss," returned Mr. Cruncher, "I hope so. Respectin' any present use o' this
    here blessed old head o' mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o' two promises and
    wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?"</p>
