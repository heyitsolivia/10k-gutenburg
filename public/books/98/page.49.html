    <p>A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the
    wine-shop, as they looked in at every place, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's gaol. Games at
    cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with
    spilt drops of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick, and saw and
    heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off.</p>

    <p>Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was high noontide, when two dusty men passed
    through his streets and under his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a mender of roads in
    a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the
    breast of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most
    doors and windows. Yet, no one had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though the eyes
    of every man there were turned upon them.</p>

    <p>"Good day, gentlemen!" said Monsieur Defarge.</p>

    <p>It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited an answering chorus of "Good day!"</p>

    <p>"It is bad weather, gentlemen," said Defarge, shaking his head.</p>

    <p>Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent. Except one man,
    who got up and went out.</p>

    <p>"My wife," said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: "I have travelled certain leagues with this good mender
    of roads, called Jacques. I met him&mdash;by accident&mdash;a day and half's journey out of Paris. He is a good
    child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to drink, my wife!"</p>

    <p>A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed
    his blue cap to the company, and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of
    this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defarge's counter. A third man got up and went
    out.</p>

    <p>Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine&mdash;but, he took less than was given to the stranger, as being
    himself a man to whom it was no rarity&mdash;and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast. He
    looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and
    was at work.</p>

    <p>"Have you finished your repast, friend?" he asked, in due season.</p>

    <p>"Yes, thank you."</p>

    <p>"Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy. It will suit you to a marvel."</p>

    <p>Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep
    staircase, out of the staircase into a garret&mdash;formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench,
    stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.</p>

    <p>No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly. And
    between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through
    the chinks in the wall.</p>

    <p>Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:</p>

    <p>"Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He
    will tell you all. Speak, Jacques Five!"</p>

    <p>The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, "Where shall I commence,
    monsieur?"</p>

    <p>"Commence," was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, "at the commencement."</p>

    <p>"I saw him then, messieurs," began the mender of roads, "a year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage
    of the Marquis, hanging by the chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed,
    the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain&mdash;like this."</p>

    <p>Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that
    time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole
    year.</p>

    <p>Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?</p>

    <p>"Never," answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.</p>

    <p>Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?</p>

    <p>"By his tall figure," said the mender of roads, softly, and with his finger at his nose. "When Monsieur the
    Marquis demands that evening, 'Say, what is he like?' I make response, 'Tall as a spectre.'"</p>

    <p>"You should have said, short as a dwarf," returned Jacques Two.</p>

    <p>"But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he confide in me. Observe! Under those
    circumstances even, I do not offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger, standing near
    our little fountain, and says, 'To me! Bring that rascal!' My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing."</p>

    <p>"He is right there, Jacques," murmured Defarge, to him who had interrupted. "Go on!"</p>

    <p>"Good!" said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. "The tall man is lost, and he is sought&mdash;how many
    months? Nine, ten, eleven?"</p>

    <p>"No matter, the number," said Defarge. "He is well hidden, but at last he is unluckily found. Go on!"</p>

    <p>"I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to go to bed. I am collecting my tools to
    descend to my cottage down in the village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see coming over
    the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man with his arms bound&mdash;tied to his sides&mdash;like
    this!"</p>

    <p>With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords
    that were knotted behind him.</p>

    <p>"I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass (for it is a
    solitary road, that, where any spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I see no more
    than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and that they are almost black to my sight&mdash;except on
    the side of the sun going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that their long shadows are on
    the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.
    Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when
    they advance quite near to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would be well content to
    precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the
    same spot!"</p>
