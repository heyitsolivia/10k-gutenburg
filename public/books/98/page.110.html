    <p>"It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment," said Madame Defarge. "Good patriots
    will know what that means. Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?"</p>

    <p>"If those eyes of yours were bed-winches," returned Miss Pross, "and I was an English four-poster, they shouldn't
    loose a splinter of me. No, you wicked foreign woman; I am your match."</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail; but, she so far understood them as to
    perceive that she was set at naught.</p>

    <p>"Woman imbecile and pig-like!" said Madame Defarge, frowning. "I take no answer from you. I demand to see her.
    Either tell her that I demand to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!" This, with an
    angry explanatory wave of her right arm.</p>

    <p>"I little thought," said Miss Pross, "that I should ever want to understand your nonsensical language; but I
    would give all I have, except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any part of it."</p>

    <p>Neither of them for a single moment released the other's eyes. Madame Defarge had not moved from the spot where
    she stood when Miss Pross first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.</p>

    <p>"I am a Briton," said Miss Pross, "I am desperate. I don't care an English Twopence for myself. I know that the
    longer I keep you here, the greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I'll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon
    your head, if you lay a finger on me!"</p>

    <p>Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence, and every rapid
    sentence a whole breath. Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.</p>

    <p>But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a
    courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. "Ha, ha!" she laughed, "you poor
    wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that Doctor." Then she raised her voice and called out, "Citizen
    Doctor! Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness
    Defarge!"</p>

    <p>Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a
    sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone. Three of the doors
    she opened swiftly, and looked in.</p>

    <p>"Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground. There
    is no one in that room behind you! Let me look."</p>

    <p>"Never!" said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer.</p>

    <p>"If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back," said Madame Defarge to
    herself.</p>

    <p>"As long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do," said Miss Pross
    to herself; "and you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you
    shall not leave here while I can hold you."</p>

    <p>"I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have
    you from that door," said Madame Defarge.</p>

    <p>"We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are not likely to be heard, and I pray for
    bodily strength to keep you here, while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my
    darling," said Miss Pross.</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the moment, seized her round the waist in both
    her arms, and held her tight. It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross, with the
    vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate, clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor
    in the struggle that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her face; but, Miss Pross, with her
    head down, held her round the waist, and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.</p>

    <p>Soon, Madame Defarge's hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled waist. "It is under my arm," said Miss
    Pross, in smothered tones, "you shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold you till
    one or other of us faints or dies!"</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge's hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash
    and a crash, and stood alone&mdash;blinded with smoke.</p>

    <p>All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful stillness, it passed out on the air, like the
    soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground.</p>

    <p>In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the body as far from it as she could, and ran
    down the stairs to call for fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did, in
    time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went
    near it, to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on, out on the staircase, first
    shutting and locking the door and taking away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and
    to cry, and then got up and hurried away.</p>

    <p>By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being
    stopped. By good fortune, too, she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any
    other woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was
    torn, and her dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a hundred ways.</p>

    <p>In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before
    her escort, and waiting there, she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if it were identified,
    what if the door were opened and the remains discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and
    charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the escort appeared, took her in, and took her
    away.</p>

    <p>"Is there any noise in the streets?" she asked him.</p>

    <p>"The usual noises," Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect.</p>

    <p>"I don't hear you," said Miss Pross. "What do you say?"</p>

    <p>It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could not hear him. "So I'll nod my head,"
    thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, "at all events she'll see that." And she did.</p>

    <p>"Is there any noise in the streets now?" asked Miss Pross again, presently.</p>

    <p>Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.</p>
