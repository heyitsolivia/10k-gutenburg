    <p>As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging circled round Defarge's wine-shop, and
    every human drop in the caldron had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself, already
    begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms, thrust this man back, dragged this man forward,
    disarmed one to arm another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.</p>

    <p>"Keep near to me, Jacques Three," cried Defarge; "and do you, Jacques One and Two, separate and put yourselves at
    the head of as many of these patriots as you can. Where is my wife?"</p>

    <p>"Eh, well! Here you see me!" said madame, composed as ever, but not knitting to-day. Madame's resolute right hand
    was occupied with an axe, in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel
    knife.</p>

    <p>"Where do you go, my wife?"</p>

    <p>"I go," said madame, "with you at present. You shall see me at the head of women, by-and-bye."</p>

    <p>"Come, then!" cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. "Patriots and friends, we are ready! The Bastille!"</p>

    <p>With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped into the detested word, the living sea
    rose, wave on wave, depth on depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums beating, the
    sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack began.</p>

    <p>Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke.
    Through the fire and through the smoke&mdash;in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against a cannon,
    and on the instant he became a cannonier&mdash;Defarge of the wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce
    hours.</p>

    <p>Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One
    drawbridge down! "Work, comrades all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques Two
    Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all the Angels or the Devils&mdash;which you
    prefer&mdash;work!" Thus Defarge of the wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot.</p>

    <p>"To me, women!" cried madame his wife. "What! We can kill as well as the men when the place is taken!" And to
    her, with a shrill thirsty cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and revenge.</p>

    <p>Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and
    the eight great towers. Slight displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing weapons,
    blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks,
    volleys, execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the furious sounding of the living sea; but,
    still the deep ditch, and the single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers, and still
    Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot by the service of Four fierce hours.</p>

    <p>A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley&mdash;this dimly perceptible through the raging storm,
    nothing audible in it&mdash;suddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the wine-shop
    over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!</p>

    <p>So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as
    impracticable as if he had been struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the outer courtyard
    of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall, he made a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly
    at his side; Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the inner distance, and her knife was
    in her hand. Everywhere was tumult, exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet furious
    dumb-show.</p>

    <p>"The Prisoners!"</p>

    <p>"The Records!"</p>

    <p>"The secret cells!"</p>

    <p>"The instruments of torture!"</p>

    <p>"The Prisoners!"</p>

    <p>Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, "The Prisoners!" was the cry most taken up by the sea that
    rushed in, as if there were an eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost billows rolled
    past, bearing the prison officers with them, and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained
    undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these men&mdash;a man with a grey head, who had a
    lighted torch in his hand&mdash;separated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the wall.</p>

    <p>"Show me the North Tower!" said Defarge. "Quick!"</p>

    <p>"I will faithfully," replied the man, "if you will come with me. But there is no one there."</p>

    <p>"What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?" asked Defarge. "Quick!"</p>

    <p>"The meaning, monsieur?"</p>

    <p>"Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean that I shall strike you dead?"</p>

    <p>"Kill him!" croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.</p>

    <p>"Monsieur, it is a cell."</p>

    <p>"Show it me!"</p>

    <p>"Pass this way, then."</p>

    <p>Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did
    not seem to promise bloodshed, held by Defarge's arm as he held by the turnkey's. Their three heads had been close
    together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another, even then: so
    tremendous was the noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and its inundation of the courts
    and passages and staircases. All around outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which,
    occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like spray.</p>

    <p>Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down
    cavernous flights of steps, and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry waterfalls than
    staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three, linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make.
    Here and there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by; but when they had done descending,
    and were winding and climbing up a tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls and
    arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise
    out of which they had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.</p>

    <p>The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung the door slowly open, and said, as they
    all bent their heads and passed in:</p>

    <p>"One hundred and five, North Tower!"</p>
