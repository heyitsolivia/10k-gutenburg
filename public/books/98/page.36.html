    <p>"I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before yesterday was, as usual, a cold one," observed
    the nephew.</p>

    <p>"I would not say happily, my friend," returned the uncle, with refined politeness; "I would not be sure of that.
    A good opportunity for consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence your destiny to far
    greater advantage than you influence it for yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,
    at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle aids to the power and honour of families,
    these slight favours that might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity. They are
    sought by so many, and they are granted (comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such
    things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding
    vulgar. From this room, many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom), one fellow,
    to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his
    daughter&mdash;<em>his</em> daughter? We have lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the
    assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as to say would, but might) cause us real
    inconvenience. All very bad, very bad!"</p>

    <p>The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head; as elegantly despondent as he could
    becomingly be of a country still containing himself, that great means of regeneration.</p>

    <p>"We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern time also," said the nephew, gloomily,
    "that I believe our name to be more detested than any name in France."</p>

    <p>"Let us hope so," said the uncle. "Detestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low."</p>

    <p>"There is not," pursued the nephew, in his former tone, "a face I can look at, in all this country round about
    us, which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery."</p>

    <p>"A compliment," said the Marquis, "to the grandeur of the family, merited by the manner in which the family has
    sustained its grandeur. Hah!" And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly crossed his legs.</p>

    <p>But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand,
    the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and dislike, than was
    comportable with its wearer's assumption of indifference.</p>

    <p>"Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear and slavery, my friend," observed the
    Marquis, "will keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof," looking up to it, "shuts out the
    sky."</p>

    <p>That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years
    hence, and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to him that night,
    he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof
    he vaunted, he might have found <em>that</em> shutting out the sky in a new way&mdash;to wit, for ever, from the eyes
    of the bodies into which its lead was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.</p>

    <p>"Meanwhile," said the Marquis, "I will preserve the honour and repose of the family, if you will not. But you
    must be fatigued. Shall we terminate our conference for the night?"</p>

    <p>"A moment more."</p>

    <p>"An hour, if you please."</p>

    <p>"Sir," said the nephew, "we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits of wrong."</p>

    <p>"<em>We</em> have done wrong?" repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile, and delicately pointing, first to his
    nephew, then to himself.</p>

    <p>"Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account to both of us, in such different ways.
    Even in my father's time, we did a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and our
    pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father's time, when it is equally yours? Can I separate my
    father's twin-brother, joint inheritor, and next successor, from himself?"</p>

    <p>"Death has done that!" said the Marquis.</p>

    <p>"And has left me," answered the nephew, "bound to a system that is frightful to me, responsible for it, but
    powerless in it; seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last look of my dear
    mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in
    vain."</p>

    <p>"Seeking them from me, my nephew," said the Marquis, touching him on the breast with his forefinger&mdash;they
    were now standing by the hearth&mdash;"you will for ever seek them in vain, be assured."</p>

    <p>Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while
    he stood looking quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he touched him on the breast, as
    though his finger were the fine point of a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the
    body, and said,</p>

    <p>"My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have lived."</p>

    <p>When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his box in his pocket.</p>

    <p>"Better to be a rational creature," he added then, after ringing a small bell on the table, "and accept your
    natural destiny. But you are lost, Monsieur Charles, I see."</p>

    <p>"This property and France are lost to me," said the nephew, sadly; "I renounce them."</p>

    <p>"Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it
    yet?"</p>

    <p>"I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed to me from you, to-morrow&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable."</p>

    <p>"&mdash;or twenty years hence&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"You do me too much honour," said the Marquis; "still, I prefer that supposition."</p>

    <p>"&mdash;I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to relinquish. What is it but a
    wilderness of misery and ruin!"</p>

    <p>"Hah!" said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.</p>

    <p>"To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a
    crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and
    suffering."</p>

    <p>"Hah!" said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.</p>

    <p>"If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is
    possible) from the weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been
    long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a
    curse on it, and on all this land."</p>
