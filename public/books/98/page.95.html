    <p>"You did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?"</p>

    <p>"I believe so."</p>

    <p>Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: "You were one of the best patriots there. Why not say so? You
    were a cannonier that day there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell. Patriots,
    I speak the truth!"</p>

    <p>It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience, thus assisted the proceedings. The
    President rang his bell; but, The Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, "I defy that bell!" wherein she
    was likewise much commended.</p>

    <p>"Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille, citizen."</p>

    <p>"I knew," said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised,
    looking steadily up at him; "I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell known as One
    Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from himself. He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five,
    North Tower, when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun that day, I resolve, when the place shall fall, to
    examine that cell. It falls. I mount to the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a
    gaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a stone has been worked out and replaced, I find
    a written paper. This is that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of
    Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette. I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to
    the hands of the President."</p>

    <p>"Let it be read."</p>

    <p>In a dead silence and stillness&mdash;the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only
    looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, Madame
    Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes
    there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them&mdash;the paper was read, as follows.</p>

    <p>"I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and afterwards resident in Paris, write this
    melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write it at stolen
    intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and
    laboriously made a place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I and my sorrows are
    dust.</p>

    <p>"These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and
    charcoal from the chimney, mixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope has quite
    departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain
    unimpaired, but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right mind&mdash;that my memory is
    exact and circumstantial&mdash;and that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words,
    whether they be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.</p>

    <p>"One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the twenty-second of the month) in the year
    1757, I was walking on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air, at an hour's
    distance from my place of residence in the Street of the School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me,
    driven very fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a
    head was put out at the window, and a voice called to the driver to stop.</p>

    <p>"The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses, and the same voice called to me by my name.
    I answered. The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight
    before I came up with it.</p>

    <p>"I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves. As they stood side by side
    near the carriage door, I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they
    were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) face too.</p>

    <p>"'You are Doctor Manette?' said one.</p>

    <p>"I am."</p>

    <p>"'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; 'the young physician, originally an expert surgeon, who
    within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris?'</p>

    <p>"'Gentlemen,' I returned, 'I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so graciously.'</p>

    <p>"'We have been to your residence,' said the first, 'and not being so fortunate as to find you there, and being
    informed that you were probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of overtaking you. Will you
    please to enter the carriage?'</p>

    <p>"The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words were spoken, so as to place me between
    themselves and the carriage door. They were armed. I was not.</p>

    <p>"'Gentlemen,' said I, 'pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance, and what is
    the nature of the case to which I am summoned.'</p>

    <p>"The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. 'Doctor, your clients are people of condition. As to
    the nature of the case, our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than
    we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to enter the carriage?'</p>

    <p>"I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They both entered after me&mdash;the last springing
    in, after putting up the steps. The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.</p>

    <p>"I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt that it is, word for word, the same. I
    describe everything exactly as it took place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where I make the
    broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my paper in its hiding-place.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>"The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and emerged upon the country road. At two-thirds
    of a league from the Barrier&mdash;I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards when I traversed
    it&mdash;it struck out of the main avenue, and presently stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and
    walked, by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed, to the door of the house. It
    was not opened immediately, in answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck the man who
    opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across the face.</p>
