    <p>The Doctor had taken care that it should be there&mdash;had assured him that it would be there&mdash;and at this
    stage of the proceedings it was produced and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen
    Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by
    the multitude of enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of
    the Abbaye&mdash;in fact, had rather passed out of the Tribunal's patriotic remembrance&mdash;until three days ago;
    when he had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury's declaring themselves satisfied that
    the accusation against him was answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde, called
    Darnay.</p>

    <p>Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity, and the clearness of his answers, made a great
    impression; but, as he proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release from his long
    imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in
    their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there, he had actually been tried for
    his life by it, as the foe of England and friend of the United States&mdash;as he brought these circumstances into
    view, with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the
    populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English gentleman then and there
    present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his account of it, the
    Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the President were content to
    receive them.</p>

    <p>At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace set up a shout of applause. All the voices
    were in the prisoner's favour, and the President declared him free.</p>

    <p>Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness, or
    their better impulses towards generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against their swollen
    account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it
    is probable, to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner was the acquittal pronounced,
    than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner
    by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of
    fainting from exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same people, carried by another
    current, would have rushed at him with the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the
    streets.</p>

    <p>His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried, rescued him from these caresses for the
    moment. Five were to be tried together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not assisted it by
    word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came
    down to him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four hours. The first of them told him so, with
    the customary prison sign of Death&mdash;a raised finger&mdash;and they all added in words, "Long live the
    Republic!"</p>

    <p>The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings, for when he and Doctor Manette emerged
    from the gate, there was a great crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in
    Court&mdash;except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the concourse made at him anew, weeping,
    embracing, and shouting, all by turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the
    mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the shore.</p>

    <p>They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had taken either out of the Court itself, or
    one of its rooms or passages. Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they had bound a pike
    with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not even the Doctor's entreaties could prevent his being carried
    to his home on men's shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him, and casting up to sight from the
    stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he was in
    the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.</p>

    <p>In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing him out, they carried him on. Reddening the
    snowy streets with the prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as they had reddened them
    below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her
    father had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his feet, she dropped insensible in his
    arms.</p>

    <p>As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd, so that his
    tears and her lips might come together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the rest fell to
    dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole. Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman
    from the crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent
    streets, and along the river's bank, and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them
    away.</p>

    <p>After grasping the Doctor's hand, as he stood victorious and proud before him; after grasping the hand of Mr.
    Lorry, who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole; after kissing
    little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful
    Pross who lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their rooms.</p>

    <p>"Lucie! My own! I am safe."</p>

    <p>"O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed to Him."</p>

    <p>They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was again in his arms, he said to her:</p>

    <p>"And now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this France could have done what he has done for
    me."</p>

    <p>She laid her head upon her father's breast, as she had laid his poor head on her own breast, long, long ago. He
    was happy in the return he had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his strength. "You
    must not be weak, my darling," he remonstrated; "don't tremble so. I have saved him."</p>
