    <p>"<em>John</em>," thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted, and her eyes looked at the stranger.
    "Stay long enough, and I shall knit 'BARSAD' before you go."</p>

    <p>"You have a husband, madame?"</p>

    <p>"I have."</p>

    <p>"Children?"</p>

    <p>"No children."</p>

    <p>"Business seems bad?"</p>

    <p>"Business is very bad; the people are so poor."</p>

    <p>"Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too&mdash;as you say."</p>

    <p>"As <em>you</em> say," madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that
    boded him no good.</p>

    <p>"Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so. Of course."</p>

    <p>"<em>I</em> think?" returned madame, in a high voice. "I and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine-shop
    open, without thinking. All we think, here, is how to live. That is the subject <em>we</em> think of, and it gives us,
    from morning to night, enough to think about, without embarrassing our heads concerning others. <em>I</em> think for
    others? No, no."</p>

    <p>The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did not allow his baffled state to express
    itself in his sinister face; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame Defarge's
    little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.</p>

    <p>"A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution. Ah! the poor Gaspard!" With a sigh of great
    compassion.</p>

    <p>"My faith!" returned madame, coolly and lightly, "if people use knives for such purposes, they have to pay for
    it. He knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price."</p>

    <p>"I believe," said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured
    revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: "I believe there is much compassion and anger in
    this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow? Between ourselves."</p>

    <p>"Is there?" asked madame, vacantly.</p>

    <p>"Is there not?"</p>

    <p>"&mdash;Here is my husband!" said Madame Defarge.</p>

    <p>As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted him by touching his hat, and saying, with an
    engaging smile, "Good day, Jacques!" Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.</p>

    <p>"Good day, Jacques!" the spy repeated; with not quite so much confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the
    stare.</p>

    <p>"You deceive yourself, monsieur," returned the keeper of the wine-shop. "You mistake me for another. That is not
    my name. I am Ernest Defarge."</p>

    <p>"It is all the same," said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: "good day!"</p>

    <p>"Good day!" answered Defarge, drily.</p>

    <p>"I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when you entered, that they tell me there
    is&mdash;and no wonder!&mdash;much sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor
    Gaspard."</p>

    <p>"No one has told me so," said Defarge, shaking his head. "I know nothing of it."</p>

    <p>Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his hand on the back of his wife's chair,
    looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would have shot with
    the greatest satisfaction.</p>

    <p>The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious attitude, but drained his little glass of
    cognac, took a sip of fresh water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it out for him, took
    to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over it.</p>

    <p>"You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?" observed Defarge.</p>

    <p>"Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants."</p>

    <p>"Hah!" muttered Defarge.</p>

    <p>"The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me," pursued the spy, "that I have the honour
    of cherishing some interesting associations with your name."</p>

    <p>"Indeed!" said Defarge, with much indifference.</p>

    <p>"Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic, had the charge of him, I know. He was
    delivered to you. You see I am informed of the circumstances?"</p>

    <p>"Such is the fact, certainly," said Defarge. He had had it conveyed to him, in an accidental touch of his wife's
    elbow as she knitted and warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.</p>

    <p>"It was to you," said the spy, "that his daughter came; and it was from your care that his daughter took him,
    accompanied by a neat brown monsieur; how is he called?&mdash;in a little wig&mdash;Lorry&mdash;of the bank of
    Tellson and Company&mdash;over to England."</p>

    <p>"Such is the fact," repeated Defarge.</p>

    <p>"Very interesting remembrances!" said the spy. "I have known Doctor Manette and his daughter, in England."</p>

    <p>"Yes?" said Defarge.</p>

    <p>"You don't hear much about them now?" said the spy.</p>

    <p>"No," said Defarge.</p>

    <p>"In effect," madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little song, "we never hear about them. We
    received the news of their safe arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then, they have
    gradually taken their road in life&mdash;we, ours&mdash;and we have held no correspondence."</p>

    <p>"Perfectly so, madame," replied the spy. "She is going to be married."</p>

    <p>"Going?" echoed madame. "She was pretty enough to have been married long ago. You English are cold, it seems to
    me."</p>

    <p>"Oh! You know I am English."</p>

    <p>"I perceive your tongue is," returned madame; "and what the tongue is, I suppose the man is."</p>

    <p>He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best of it, and turned it off with a laugh.
    After sipping his cognac to the end, he added:</p>

    <p>"Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to one who, like herself, is French by
    birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah, poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is going to
    marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other
    words, the present Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is Mr. Charles Darnay.
    D'Aulnais is the name of his mother's family."</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband. Do what he would,
    behind the little counter, as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was troubled, and his hand
    was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.</p>

    <p>Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be worth, and no customers coming in to help him
    to any other, Mr. Barsad paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say, in a genteel
    manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For
    some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the husband and wife remained exactly as
    he had left them, lest he should come back.</p>
