    <p>"What's <em>he</em> got to do with the case?" asked the man he had spoken with.</p>

    <p>"Blest if I know," said Jerry.</p>

    <p>"What have <em>you</em> got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?"</p>

    <p>"Blest if I know that either," said Jerry.</p>

    <p>The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling down in the court, stopped the dialogue.
    Presently, the dock became the central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there, went out, and
    the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.</p>

    <p>Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath
    in the place, rolled at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round pillars and corners, to
    get a sight of him; spectators in back rows stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court,
    laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help themselves, at anybody's cost, to a view of
    him&mdash;stood a-tiptoe, got upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him. Conspicuous among
    these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery
    breath of a whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer, and gin,
    and tea, and coffee, and what not, that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an
    impure mist and rain.</p>

    <p>The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about five-and-twenty, well-grown and
    well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was plainly
    dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of
    his neck; more to be out of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any
    covering of the body, so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing
    the soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed, bowed to the Judge, and stood
    quiet.</p>

    <p>The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at, was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had
    he stood in peril of a less horrible sentence&mdash;had there been a chance of any one of its savage details being
    spared&mdash;by just so much would he have lost in his fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so
    shamefully mangled, was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder, yielded the
    sensation. Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and powers
    of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.</p>

    <p>Silence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to an indictment denouncing him (with
    infinite jingle and jangle) for that he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth,
    prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted
    Lewis, the French King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth; that was to say,
    by coming and going, between the dominions of our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of
    the said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said
    French Lewis what forces our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation to send to Canada
    and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made
    out with huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that the aforesaid, and over and over
    again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and that Mr.
    Attorney-General was making ready to speak.</p>

    <p>The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged, beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there,
    neither flinched from the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet and attentive; watched the
    opening proceedings with a grave interest; and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so
    composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn. The court was all bestrewn
    with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.</p>

    <p>Over the prisoner's head there was a mirror, to throw the light down upon him. Crowds of the wicked and the
    wretched had been reflected in it, and had passed from its surface and this earth's together. Haunted in a most
    ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as
    the ocean is one day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been
    reserved, may have struck the prisoner's mind. Be that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a
    bar of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his face flushed, and his right hand pushed
    the herbs away.</p>

    <p>It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left. About on a level
    with his eyes, there sat, in that corner of the Judge's bench, two persons upon whom his look immediately rested; so
    immediately, and so much to the changing of his aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to
    them.</p>

    <p>The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently
    her father; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair, and a certain
    indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind, but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was
    upon him, he looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up&mdash;as it was now, in a moment, on
    his speaking to his daughter&mdash;he became a handsome man, not past the prime of life.</p>

    <p>His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by him, and the other pressed upon it. She
    had drawn close to him, in her dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead had been
    strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had
    been so very noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who had had no pity for him were
    touched by her; and the whisper went about, "Who are they?"</p>

    <p>Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own manner, and who had been sucking the rust off
    his fingers in his absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about him had pressed and passed
    the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it
    got to Jerry:</p>
