    <p>The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for
    this legend. He had got somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriate
    difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed pike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed
    his saw inscribed as his "Little Sainte Guillotine"&mdash;for the great sharp female was by that time popularly
    canonised. His shop was shut and he was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.</p>

    <p>But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along, which filled
    her with fear. A moment afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall, in the
    midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred
    people, and they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music than their own singing. They
    danced to the popular Revolution song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison. Men and
    women danced together, women danced together, men danced together, as hazard had brought them together. At first,
    they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they filled the place, and stopped to
    dance about Lucie, some ghastly apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They advanced,
    retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one another's heads, spun round alone, caught one another and
    spun round in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest linked hand in hand, and all spun
    round together: then the ring broke, and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all
    stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then reversed the spin, and all spun round another
    way. Suddenly they stopped again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width of the public way,
    and, with their heads low down and their hands high up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so
    terrible as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport&mdash;a something, once innocent, delivered over to
    all devilry&mdash;a healthy pastime changed into a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling
    the heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how warped and perverted all things good by
    nature were become. The maidenly bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted, the delicate
    foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of the disjointed time.</p>

    <p>This was the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the
    wood-sawyer's house, the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.</p>

    <p>"O my father!" for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had momentarily darkened with her hand;
    "such a cruel, bad sight."</p>

    <p>"I know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Don't be frightened! Not one of them would harm you."</p>

    <p>"I am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my husband, and the mercies of these
    people&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"We will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him climbing to the window, and I came to tell you. There
    is no one here to see. You may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof."</p>

    <p>"I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!"</p>

    <p>"You cannot see him, my poor dear?"</p>

    <p>"No, father," said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand, "no."</p>

    <p>A footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. "I salute you, citizeness," from the Doctor. "I salute you, citizen."
    This in passing. Nothing more. Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.</p>

    <p>"Give me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage, for his sake. That was well
    done;" they had left the spot; "it shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for to-morrow."</p>

    <p>"For to-morrow!"</p>

    <p>"There is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are precautions to be taken, that could not be taken
    until he was actually summoned before the Tribunal. He has not received the notice yet, but I know that he will
    presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not
    afraid?"</p>

    <p>She could scarcely answer, "I trust in you."</p>

    <p>"Do so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall be restored to you within a few hours; I
    have encompassed him with every protection. I must see Lorry."</p>

    <p>He stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. They both knew too well what it meant. One.
    Two. Three. Three tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.</p>

    <p>"I must see Lorry," the Doctor repeated, turning her another way.</p>

    <p>The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. He and his books were in frequent
    requisition as to property confiscated and made national. What he could save for the owners, he saved. No better man
    living to hold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping, and to hold his peace.</p>

    <p>A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted the approach of darkness. It was almost
    dark when they arrived at the Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and deserted. Above
    a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters: National Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty,
    Equality, Fraternity, or Death!</p>

    <p>Who could that be with Mr. Lorry&mdash;the owner of the riding-coat upon the chair&mdash;who must not be seen?
    From whom newly arrived, did he come out, agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms? To whom did he
    appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from
    which he had issued, he said: "Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?"</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">VI. Triumph</h2>
    <p>The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth
    every evening, and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The standard gaoler-joke
    was, "Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you inside there!"</p>

    <p>"Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!"</p>

    <p>So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.</p>

    <p>When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus
    fatally recorded. Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen hundreds pass away
    so.</p>
