    <p>Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs, both private and public; and
    he had, as to both classes of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances public, because
    Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to
    finances private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after generations of great luxury and expense,
    was growing poor. Hence Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet time to ward off the
    impending veil, the cheapest garment she could wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich
    Farmer-General, poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of
    it, was now among the company in the outer rooms, much prostrated before by mankind&mdash;always excepting superior
    mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked down upon him with the loftiest
    contempt.</p>

    <p>A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his
    halls, six body-women waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could,
    the Farmer-General&mdash;howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality&mdash;was at least the
    greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.</p>

    <p>For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste
    and skill of the time could achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any reference to the
    scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre
    Dame, almost equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would have been an exceedingly
    uncomfortable business&mdash;if that could have been anybody's business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military
    officers destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship; civil officers without a notion of
    affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives; all
    totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or
    remotely of the order of Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be
    got; these were to be told off by the score and the score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the
    State, yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road
    to any true earthly end, were no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary
    disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who
    had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the State was touched, except the remedy of
    setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay
    hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and
    making card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving Chemists who had an eye on the
    transmutation of metals, at this wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of the finest
    breeding, which was at that remarkable time&mdash;and has been since&mdash;to be known by its fruits of indifference
    to every natural subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion, at the hotel of
    Monseigneur. Such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies
    among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur&mdash;forming a goodly half of the polite company&mdash;would have found
    it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and appearance, owned to
    being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world&mdash;which does
    not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother&mdash;there was no such thing known to the fashion. Peasant
    women kept the unfashionable babies close, and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped
    as at twenty.</p>

    <p>The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room
    were half a dozen exceptional people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that things in
    general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting them right, half of the half-dozen had become members
    of a fantastic sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam,
    rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the spot&mdash;thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the
    Future, for Monseigneur's guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other three who had rushed into another sect,
    which mended matters with a jargon about "the Centre of Truth:" holding that Man had got out of the Centre of
    Truth&mdash;which did not need much demonstration&mdash;but had not got out of the Circumference, and that he was to
    be kept from flying out of the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre, by fasting and seeing
    of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much discoursing with spirits went on&mdash;and it did a world of good which
    never became manifest.</p>

    <p>But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day
    of Judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally correct. Such
    frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such
    gallant swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would surely keep anything going, for
    ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they
    languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells; and what with that ringing, and with the
    rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and his
    devouring hunger far away.</p>

    <p>Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places. Everybody was dressed
    for a Fancy Ball that was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through Monseigneur and the whole
    Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball
    descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was required to officiate "frizzled, powdered,
    in a gold-laced coat, pumps, and white silk stockings." At the gallows and the wheel&mdash;the axe was a
    rarity&mdash;Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother Professors of the provinces, Monsieur
    Orleans, and the rest, to call him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at Monseigneur's
    reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a
    frizzled hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see the very stars out!</p>
