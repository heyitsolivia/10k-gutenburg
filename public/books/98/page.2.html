    <p>With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling
    between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested them and
    brought them to a stand, with a wary "Wo-ho! so-ho-then!" the near leader violently shook his head and everything
    upon it&mdash;like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill. Whenever the leader
    made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.</p>

    <p>There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil
    spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in
    ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense
    enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road;
    and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.</p>

    <p>Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were wrapped
    to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he
    saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the
    mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being
    confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the
    latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in "the Captain's" pay, ranging from the
    landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of the Dover
    mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up
    Shooter's Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a
    hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,
    deposited on a substratum of cutlass.</p>

    <p>The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected
    one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses;
    as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit
    for the journey.</p>

    <p>"Wo-ho!" said the coachman. "So, then! One more pull and you're at the top and be damned to you, for I have had
    trouble enough to get you to it!&mdash;Joe!"</p>

    <p>"Halloa!" the guard replied.</p>

    <p>"What o'clock do you make it, Joe?"</p>

    <p>"Ten minutes, good, past eleven."</p>

    <p>"My blood!" ejaculated the vexed coachman, "and not atop of Shooter's yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!"</p>

    <p>The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the
    three other horses followed suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers
    squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any
    one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness,
    he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.</p>

    <p>The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses stopped to breathe again, and the guard got
    down to skid the wheel for the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.</p>

    <p>"Tst! Joe!" cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his box.</p>

    <p>"What do you say, Tom?"</p>

    <p>They both listened.</p>

    <p>"I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe."</p>

    <p>"<em>I</em> say a horse at a gallop, Tom," returned the guard, leaving his hold of the door, and mounting nimbly to
    his place. "Gentlemen! In the king's name, all of you!"</p>

    <p>With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on the offensive.</p>

    <p>The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close
    behind him, and about to follow. He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained in the
    road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened.
    The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked
    back, without contradicting.</p>

    <p>The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of
    the night, made it very quiet indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if
    it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate,
    the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses
    quickened by expectation.</p>

    <p>The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.</p>

    <p>"So-ho!" the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. "Yo there! Stand! I shall fire!"</p>

    <p>The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man's voice called from the mist, "Is
    that the Dover mail?"</p>

    <p>"Never you mind what it is!" the guard retorted. "What are you?"</p>

    <p>"<em>Is</em> that the Dover mail?"</p>

    <p>"Why do you want to know?"</p>

    <p>"I want a passenger, if it is."</p>

    <p>"What passenger?"</p>

    <p>"Mr. Jarvis Lorry."</p>

    <p>Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard, the coachman, and the two other
    passengers eyed him distrustfully.</p>

    <p>"Keep where you are," the guard called to the voice in the mist, "because, if I should make a mistake, it could
    never be set right in your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight."</p>

    <p>"What is the matter?" asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering speech. "Who wants me? Is it Jerry?"</p>

    <p>("I don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry," growled the guard to himself. "He's hoarser than suits me, is
    Jerry.")</p>

    <p>"Yes, Mr. Lorry."</p>

    <p>"What is the matter?"</p>

    <p>"A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co."</p>

    <p>"I know this messenger, guard," said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the road&mdash;assisted from behind more
    swiftly than politely by the other two passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and
    pulled up the window. "He may come close; there's nothing wrong."</p>

    <p>"I hope there ain't, but I can't make so 'Nation sure of that," said the guard, in gruff soliloquy. "Hallo
    you!"</p>
