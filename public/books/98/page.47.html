    <p>Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations, but made use of them, as people not
    unfrequently do, to express general ironical dissatisfaction.</p>

    <p>"You and your yes, Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it
    down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer. "Ah! I think so. I believe you."</p>

    <p>"You are going out to-night?" asked his decent wife, when he took another bite.</p>

    <p>"Yes, I am."</p>

    <p>"May I go with you, father?" asked his son, briskly.</p>

    <p>"No, you mayn't. I'm a going&mdash;as your mother knows&mdash;a fishing. That's where I'm going to. Going a
    fishing."</p>

    <p>"Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?"</p>

    <p>"Never you mind."</p>

    <p>"Shall you bring any fish home, father?"</p>

    <p>"If I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow," returned that gentleman, shaking his head; "that's questions
    enough for you; I ain't a going out, till you've been long abed."</p>

    <p>He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and
    sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage.
    With this view, he urged his son to hold her in conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by
    dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than he would leave her for a moment to her
    own reflections. The devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than
    he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost
    story.</p>

    <p>"And mind you!" said Mr. Cruncher. "No games to-morrow! If I, as a honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte
    of meat or two, none of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest tradesman, am able to
    provide a little beer, none of your declaring on water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly
    customer to you, if you don't. <em>I</em>'m your Rome, you know."</p>

    <p>Then he began grumbling again:</p>

    <p>"With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I don't know how scarce you mayn't make the
    wittles and drink here, by your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he <em>is</em> your'n,
    ain't he? He's as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother, and not know that a mother's first duty is to blow
    her boy out?"</p>

    <p>This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to perform her first duty, and, whatever else
    she did or neglected, above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so
    affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.</p>

    <p>Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid
    under similar injunctions, obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes,
    and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one o'clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from
    his chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient
    size, a rope and chain, and other fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him in skilful
    manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher, extinguished the light, and went out.</p>

    <p>Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed, was not long after his father. Under
    cover of the darkness he followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the court, followed out
    into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers,
    and the door stood ajar all night.</p>

    <p>Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his father's honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping
    as close to house fronts, walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his honoured parent in
    view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak
    Walton, and the two trudged on together.</p>

    <p>Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the winking lamps, and the more than winking
    watchmen, and were out upon a lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here&mdash;and that so silently, that if
    Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a
    sudden, split himself into two.</p>

    <p>The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the
    top of the bank was a low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and wall the three turned
    out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which the wall&mdash;there, risen to some eight or ten feet
    high&mdash;formed one side. Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that Young Jerry saw,
    was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron
    gate. He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the third. They all dropped softly on the
    ground within the gate, and lay there a little&mdash;listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands and
    knees.</p>

    <p>It was now Young Jerry's turn to approach the gate: which he did, holding his breath. Crouching down again in a
    corner there, and looking in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass! and all the
    gravestones in the churchyard&mdash;it was a large churchyard that they were in&mdash;looking on like ghosts in
    white, while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not creep far, before
    they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to fish.</p>

    <p>They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a
    great corkscrew. Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful striking of the church clock so
    terrified Young Jerry, that he made off, with his hair as stiff as his father's.</p>

    <p>But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not only stopped him in his running away, but
    lured him back again. They were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for the second time; but,
    now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures
    were strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it, and came to the surface.
    Young Jerry very well knew what it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it
    open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he made off again, and never stopped until he had run a
    mile or more.</p>
