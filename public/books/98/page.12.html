    <p>Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked up again: not with any interest or
    curiosity, but with a dull mechanical perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were aware
    of had stood, was not yet empty.</p>

    <p>"I want," said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker, "to let in a little more light here. You
    can bear a little more?"</p>

    <p>The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening, at the floor on one side of him; then
    similarly, at the floor on the other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.</p>

    <p>"What did you say?"</p>

    <p>"You can bear a little more light?"</p>

    <p>"I must bear it, if you let it in." (Laying the palest shadow of a stress upon the second word.)</p>

    <p>The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that angle for the time. A broad ray of light
    fell into the garret, and showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his labour. His few
    common tools and various scraps of leather were at his feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut,
    but not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and thinness of his face would have
    caused them to look large, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really
    otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so. His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the
    throat, and showed his body to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose stockings, and all
    his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull
    uniformity of parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.</p>

    <p>He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with
    a steadfastly vacant gaze, pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without first looking down
    on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke,
    without first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.</p>

    <p>"Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?" asked Defarge, motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.</p>

    <p>"What did you say?"</p>

    <p>"Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?"</p>

    <p>"I can't say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don't know."</p>

    <p>But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When he had stood, for a minute or two, by the
    side of Defarge, the shoemaker looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the unsteady fingers
    of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale
    lead-colour), and then the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The look and the action
    had occupied but an instant.</p>

    <p>"You have a visitor, you see," said Monsieur Defarge.</p>

    <p>"What did you say?"</p>

    <p>"Here is a visitor."</p>

    <p>The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his work.</p>

    <p>"Come!" said Defarge. "Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when he sees one. Show him that shoe you are
    working at. Take it, monsieur."</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.</p>

    <p>"Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker's name."</p>

    <p>There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:</p>

    <p>"I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?"</p>

    <p>"I said, couldn't you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur's information?"</p>

    <p>"It is a lady's shoe. It is a young lady's walking-shoe. It is in the present mode. I never saw the mode. I have
    had a pattern in my hand." He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.</p>

    <p>"And the maker's name?" said Defarge.</p>

    <p>Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left, and then the
    knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and so on in
    regular changes, without a moment's intermission. The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always
    sank when he had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or endeavouring, in the hope of some
    disclosure, to stay the spirit of a fast-dying man.</p>

    <p>"Did you ask me for my name?"</p>

    <p>"Assuredly I did."</p>

    <p>"One Hundred and Five, North Tower."</p>

    <p>"Is that all?"</p>

    <p>"One Hundred and Five, North Tower."</p>

    <p>With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work again, until the silence was again
    broken.</p>

    <p>"You are not a shoemaker by trade?" said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly at him.</p>

    <p>His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the question to him: but as no help came from
    that quarter, they turned back on the questioner when they had sought the ground.</p>

    <p>"I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I-I learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked
    leave to&mdash;"</p>

    <p>He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his hands the whole time. His eyes came
    slowly back, at last, to the face from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and resumed, in
    the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a subject of last night.</p>

    <p>"I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after a long while, and I have made shoes ever
    since."</p>

    <p>As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr. Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in
    his face:</p>

    <p>"Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?"</p>

    <p>The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the questioner.</p>

    <p>"Monsieur Manette"; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge's arm; "do you remember nothing of this man? Look at
    him. Look at me. Is there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your mind, Monsieur
    Manette?"</p>

    <p>As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr. Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated
    marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the
    black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been
    there. And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a
    point where she could see him, and where she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only
    raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him, but which were now
    extending towards him, trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast, and love it
    back to life and hope&mdash;so exactly was the expression repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young
    face, that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.</p>
