    <p>What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already at work on the hill-top beyond the
    village, with his day's dinner (not much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to peck at,
    on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow
    chance seeds? Whether or no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life, down the hill,
    knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the fountain.</p>

    <p>All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about in their depressed manner, and whispering low,
    but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought in and tethered to
    anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly
    repaying their trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of the people of the chateau,
    and some of those of the posting-house, and all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded on
    the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender
    of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself in the breast
    with his blue cap. What did all this portend, and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a
    servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle (double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop,
    like a new version of the German ballad of Leonora?</p>

    <p>It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.</p>

    <p>The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added the one stone face wanting; the stone face
    for which it had waited through about two hundred years.</p>

    <p>It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and
    petrified. Driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt was a frill of
    paper, on which was scrawled:</p>

    <p>"Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques."</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">X. Two Promises</h2>
    <p>More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles Darnay was established in England as a
    higher teacher of the French language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he would have been a
    Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study
    of a living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy. He
    could write of them, besides, in sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not at that
    time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no
    ruined nobility had dropped out of Tellson's ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a tutor, whose attainments
    made the student's way unusually pleasant and profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
    work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became known and encouraged. He was well acquainted,
    more-over, with the circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest. So, with great
    perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.</p>

    <p>In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any
    such exalted expectation, he would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it, and did it and made
    the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.</p>

    <p>A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated
    smuggler who drove a contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek and Latin through the
    Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in London.</p>

    <p>Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes,
    the world of a man has invariably gone one way&mdash;Charles Darnay's way&mdash;the way of the love of a woman.</p>

    <p>He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound
    of her compassionate voice; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was confronted with his
    own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the
    assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long, long, dusty roads&mdash;the
    solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dream&mdash;had been done a year, and he had never
    yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.</p>

    <p>That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a summer day when, lately arrived in London
    from his college occupation, he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his
    mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.</p>

    <p>He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy which had at once supported him under his
    old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a very energetic man
    indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was
    sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but,
    this had never been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.</p>

    <p>He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now
    entered Charles Darnay, at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.</p>

    <p>"Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your return these three or four days past. Mr.
    Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due."</p>

    <p>"I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter," he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very
    warmly as to the Doctor. "Miss Manette&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Is well," said the Doctor, as he stopped short, "and your return will delight us all. She has gone out on some
    household matters, but will soon be home."</p>

    <p>"Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to
    you."</p>

    <p>There was a blank silence.</p>

    <p>"Yes?" said the Doctor, with evident constraint. "Bring your chair here, and speak on."</p>
