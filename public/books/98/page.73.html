    <p>That night&mdash;it was the fourteenth of August&mdash;he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to
    Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons that he
    had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor,
    confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances. To
    both, he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.</p>

    <p>It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind. It
    was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious. But, an affectionate
    glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do
    it, so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and the day passed quickly. Early in the
    evening he embraced her, and her scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye (an
    imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy
    mist of the heavy streets, with a heavier heart.</p>

    <p>The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides and winds were setting straight and
    strong towards it. He left his two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before midnight, and
    no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey. "For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the
    honour of your noble name!" was the poor prisoner's cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart, as he left all
    that was dear on earth behind him, and floated away for the Loadstone Rock.</p>

    <p>The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from England in the autumn of the year one
    thousand seven hundred and ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad horses, he would have
    encountered to delay him, though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his
    glory; but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house
    had its band of citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness, who stopped
    all comers and goers, cross-questioned them, inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own,
    turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy
    deemed best for the dawning Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.</p>

    <p>A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him
    along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris.
    Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey's end. Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier
    dropped across the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him
    and England. The universal watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net, or were being
    forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone.</p>

    <p>This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage, but retarded his
    progress twenty times in a day, by riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him by
    anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been days upon his journey in France alone, when he
    went to bed tired out, in a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.</p>

    <p>Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his prison of the Abbaye would have got him on
    so far. His difficulty at the guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey to have come
    to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn
    to which he had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.</p>

    <p>Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths,
    who sat down on the bed.</p>

    <p>"Emigrant," said the functionary, "I am going to send you on to Paris, under an escort."</p>

    <p>"Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could dispense with the escort."</p>

    <p>"Silence!" growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his musket. "Peace, aristocrat!"</p>

    <p>"It is as the good patriot says," observed the timid functionary. "You are an aristocrat, and must have an
    escort&mdash;and must pay for it."</p>

    <p>"I have no choice," said Charles Darnay.</p>

    <p>"Choice! Listen to him!" cried the same scowling red-cap. "As if it was not a favour to be protected from the
    lamp-iron!"</p>

    <p>"It is always as the good patriot says," observed the functionary. "Rise and dress yourself, emigrant."</p>

    <p>Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking,
    drinking, and sleeping, by a watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he started with it on
    the wet, wet roads at three o'clock in the morning.</p>

    <p>The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured cockades, armed with national muskets and
    sabres, who rode one on either side of him.</p>

    <p>The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to his bridle, the end of which one of the
    patriots kept girded round his wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces:
    clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement, and out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state
    they traversed without change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay between them and the
    capital.</p>

    <p>They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and lying by until the twilight fell. The
    escort were so wretchedly clothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged
    shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended, and apart from such
    considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying his musket
    very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in
    his breast; for, he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that
    was not yet stated, and of representations, confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.</p>
