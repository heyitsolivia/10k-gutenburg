    <p>"I do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks."</p>

    <p>"What," said Carton, still only half turned towards him, "do you expect, Mr. Darnay?"</p>

    <p>"The worst."</p>

    <p>"It's the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their withdrawing is in your favour."</p>

    <p>Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no more: but left them&mdash;so like each other
    in feature, so unlike each other in manner&mdash;standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above them.</p>

    <p>An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded passages below, even though assisted off
    with mutton pies and ale. The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection, had
    dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court,
    carried him along with them.</p>

    <p>"Jerry! Jerry!" Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got there.</p>

    <p>"Here, sir! It's a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!"</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. "Quick! Have you got it?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

    <p>Hastily written on the paper was the word "ACQUITTED."</p>

    <p>"If you had sent the message, 'Recalled to Life,' again," muttered Jerry, as he turned, "I should have known what
    you meant, this time."</p>

    <p>He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else, until he was clear of the Old Bailey;
    for, the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz swept into the
    street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search of other carrion.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">IV. Congratulatory</h2>
    <p>From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all
    day, was straining off, when Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor for the defence,
    and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr. Charles Darnay&mdash;just released&mdash;congratulating him
    on his escape from death.</p>

    <p>It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and
    upright of bearing, the shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him twice, without
    looking again: even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave
    voice, and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent reason. While one external cause,
    and that a reference to his long lingering agony, would always&mdash;as on the trial&mdash;evoke this condition from
    the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as
    incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual Bastille thrown
    upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three hundred miles away.</p>

    <p>Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind. She was the golden thread that
    united him to a Past beyond his misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice, the light of
    her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always,
    for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few and slight, and she believed
    them over.</p>

    <p>Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked.
    Mr. Stryver, a man of little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout, loud, red, bluff,
    and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into
    companies and conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.</p>

    <p>He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he
    squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean out of the group: "I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr. Darnay.
    It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the less likely to succeed on that account."</p>

    <p>"You have laid me under an obligation to you for life&mdash;in two senses," said his late client, taking his
    hand.</p>

    <p>"I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as another man's, I believe."</p>

    <p>It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, "Much better," Mr. Lorry said it; perhaps not quite
    disinterestedly, but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again.</p>

    <p>"You think so?" said Mr. Stryver. "Well! you have been present all day, and you ought to know. You are a man of
    business, too."</p>

    <p>"And as such," quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group, just
    as he had previously shouldered him out of it&mdash;"as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up this
    conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn
    out."</p>

    <p>"Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry," said Stryver; "I have a night's work to do yet. Speak for yourself."</p>

    <p>"I speak for myself," answered Mr. Lorry, "and for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and&mdash;Miss Lucie, do you
    not think I may speak for us all?" He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.</p>

    <p>His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown
    of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered
    away.</p>

    <p>"My father," said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.</p>

    <p>He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.</p>

    <p>"Shall we go home, my father?"</p>

    <p>With a long breath, he answered "Yes."</p>

    <p>The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression&mdash;which he himself had
    originated&mdash;that he would not be released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages,
    the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow
    morning's interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it. Walking between her
    father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and
    daughter departed in it.</p>

    <p>Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room. Another person, who had
    not joined the group, or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where
    its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He
    now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.</p>
