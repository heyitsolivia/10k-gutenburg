    <p>"The boy's eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now slowly moved to me.</p>

    <p>"'Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are proud too, sometimes. They plunder us,
    outrage us, beat us, kill us; but we have a little pride left, sometimes. She&mdash;have you seen her, Doctor?'</p>

    <p>"The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the distance. He referred to them, as if she
    were lying in our presence.</p>

    <p>"I said, 'I have seen her.'</p>

    <p>"'She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our
    sisters, many years, but we have had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my father say so. She was a good
    girl. She was betrothed to a good young man, too: a tenant of his. We were all tenants of his&mdash;that man's who
    stands there. The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.'</p>

    <p>"It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a
    dreadful emphasis.</p>

    <p>"'We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs are by those superior Beings&mdash;taxed
    by him without mercy, obliged to work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged to feed
    scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own,
    pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we ate it in fear, with the door
    barred and the shutters closed, that his people should not see it and take it from us&mdash;I say, we were so
    robbed, and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the
    world, and that what we should most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable race die
    out!'</p>

    <p>"I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth like a fire. I had supposed that it must be
    latent in the people somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the dying boy.</p>

    <p>"'Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that time, poor fellow, and she married her lover,
    that she might tend and comfort him in our cottage&mdash;our dog-hut, as that man would call it. She had not been
    married many weeks, when that man's brother saw her and admired her, and asked that man to lend her to him&mdash;for
    what are husbands among us! He was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and hated his brother with a
    hatred as strong as mine. What did the two then, to persuade her husband to use his influence with her, to make her
    willing?'</p>

    <p>"The boy's eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that
    all he said was true. The two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this Bastille; the
    gentleman's, all negligent indifference; the peasant's, all trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.</p>

    <p>"'You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us.
    They so harnessed him and drove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their grounds all night,
    quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed. They kept him out in the unwholesome mists
    at night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. But he was not persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one
    day at noon, to feed&mdash;if he could find food&mdash;he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the bell,
    and died on her bosom.'</p>

    <p>"Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong. He forced back the
    gathering shadows of death, as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his wound.</p>

    <p>"'Then, with that man's permission and even with his aid, his brother took her away; in spite of what I know she
    must have told his brother&mdash;and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if it is now&mdash;his
    brother took her away&mdash;for his pleasure and diversion, for a little while. I saw her pass me on the road. When
    I took the tidings home, our father's heart burst; he never spoke one of the words that filled it. I took my young
    sister (for I have another) to a place beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be
    <em>his</em> vassal. Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed in&mdash;a common dog, but sword in
    hand.&mdash;Where is the loft window? It was somewhere here?'</p>

    <p>"The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around him. I glanced about me, and saw that the
    hay and straw were trampled over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.</p>

    <p>"'She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he was dead. He came in and first tossed me some
    pieces of money; then struck at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to make him draw.
    Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend
    himself&mdash;thrust at me with all his skill for his life.'</p>

    <p>"My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of a broken sword, lying among the hay. That
    weapon was a gentleman's. In another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier's.</p>

    <p>"'Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?'</p>

    <p>"'He is not here,' I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he referred to the brother.</p>

    <p>"'He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the man who was here? Turn my face to
    him.'</p>

    <p>"I did so, raising the boy's head against my knee. But, invested for the moment with extraordinary power, he
    raised himself completely: obliging me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.</p>

    <p>"'Marquis,' said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and his right hand raised, 'in the days when
    all these things are to be answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to answer for them. I
    mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that I do it. In the days when all these things are to be answered for,
    I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them separately. I mark this cross of blood upon
    him, as a sign that I do it.'</p>

    <p>"Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air. He stood for
    an instant with the finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him down dead.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>"When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity.
    I knew that this might last for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave.</p>
