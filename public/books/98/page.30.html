    <p>Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr.
    Carton had lounged in, but he made only Two.</p>

    <p>The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and windows open, they were overpowered by heat.
    When the tea-table was done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the heavy twilight.
    Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white,
    and some of the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the ceiling, and waved them like
    spectral wings.</p>

    <p>"The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few," said Doctor Manette. "It comes slowly."</p>

    <p>"It comes surely," said Carton.</p>

    <p>They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a dark room, watching and waiting for
    Lightning, always do.</p>

    <p>There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke; the
    wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a footstep was
    there.</p>

    <p>"A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!" said Darnay, when they had listened for a while.</p>

    <p>"Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?" asked Lucie. "Sometimes, I have sat here of an evening, until I have
    fancied&mdash;but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and
    solemn&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Let us shudder too. We may know what it is."</p>

    <p>"It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we originate them, I think; they are not to be
    communicated. I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made the echoes out to be the
    echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-bye into our lives."</p>

    <p>"There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so," Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody
    way.</p>

    <p>The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed
    with the tread of feet; some, as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some coming, some
    going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in the distant streets, and not one within sight.</p>

    <p>"Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or are we to divide them among us?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you asked for it. When I have yielded myself to
    it, I have been alone, and then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life, and
    my father's."</p>

    <p>"I take them into mine!" said Carton. "<em>I</em> ask no questions and make no stipulations. There is a great crowd
    bearing down upon us, Miss Manette, and I see them&mdash;by the Lightning." He added the last words, after there had
    been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.</p>

    <p>"And I hear them!" he added again, after a peal of thunder. "Here they come, fast, fierce, and furious!"</p>

    <p>It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him, for no voice could be heard in it. A
    memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment's interval in
    crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at midnight.</p>

    <p>The great bell of Saint Paul's was striking one in the cleared air, when Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry,
    high-booted and bearing a lantern, set forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches of
    road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this
    service: though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier.</p>

    <p>"What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry," said Mr. Lorry, "to bring the dead out of their graves."</p>

    <p>"I never see the night myself, master&mdash;nor yet I don't expect to&mdash;what would do that," answered
    Jerry.</p>

    <p>"Good night, Mr. Carton," said the man of business. "Good night, Mr. Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night
    again, together!"</p>

    <p>Perhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar, bearing down upon them, too.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">VII. Monseigneur in Town</h2>
    <p>Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in
    Paris. Monseigneur was in his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to the crowd of
    worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a
    great many things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing France; but,
    his morning's chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four strong men
    besides the Cook.</p>

    <p>Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer
    than two gold watches in his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to conduct the
    happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips. One lacquey carried the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second,
    milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function; a third, presented the
    favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur
    to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens. Deep
    would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men; he must
    have died of two.</p>

    <p>Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly
    represented. Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so
    impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome
    articles of state affairs and state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance for France, as the
    like always is for all countries similarly favoured!&mdash;always was for England (by way of example), in the
    regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it.</p>

    <p>Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which was, to let everything go on in its own
    way; of particular public business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his
    way&mdash;tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and particular, Monseigneur had the other
    truly noble idea, that the world was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original by only a
    pronoun, which is not much) ran: "The earth and the fulness thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur."</p>
