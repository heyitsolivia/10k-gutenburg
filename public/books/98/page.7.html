    <p>"But this is my father's story, sir; and I begin to think"&mdash;the curiously roughened forehead was very intent
    upon him&mdash;"that when I was left an orphan through my mother's surviving my father only two years, it was you
    who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you."</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced to take his, and he put it with some ceremony
    to his lips. He then conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding the chair-back with his
    left hand, and using his right by turns to rub his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood
    looking down into her face while she sat looking up into his.</p>

    <p>"Miss Manette, it <em>was</em> I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself just now, in saying I had no
    feelings, and that all the relations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect
    that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of Tellson's House since, and I have been busy with the
    other business of Tellson's House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance of them. I pass my whole life,
    miss, in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle."</p>

    <p>After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head
    with both hands (which was most unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before), and
    resumed his former attitude.</p>

    <p>"So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your regretted father. Now comes the difference. If
    your father had not died when he did&mdash;Don't be frightened! How you start!"</p>

    <p>She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.</p>

    <p>"Pray," said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from the back of the chair to lay it on the
    supplicatory fingers that clasped him in so violent a tremble: "pray control your agitation&mdash;a matter of
    business. As I was saying&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:</p>

    <p>"As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly and silently disappeared; if he had been
    spirited away; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could trace him; if he
    had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people
    afraid to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the privilege of filling up blank forms for
    the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king,
    the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in vain;&mdash;then the history of your
    father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais."</p>

    <p>"I entreat you to tell me more, sir."</p>

    <p>"I will. I am going to. You can bear it?"</p>

    <p>"I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this moment."</p>

    <p>"You speak collectedly, and you&mdash;<em>are</em> collected. That's good!" (Though his manner was less satisfied
    than his words.) "A matter of business. Regard it as a matter of business&mdash;business that must be done. Now if
    this doctor's wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit, had suffered so intensely from this cause before her
    little child was born&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"The little child was a daughter, sir."</p>

    <p>"A daughter. A-a-matter of business&mdash;don't be distressed. Miss, if the poor lady had suffered so intensely
    before her little child was born, that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of
    any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead&mdash;No,
    don't kneel! In Heaven's name why should you kneel to me!"</p>

    <p>"For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!"</p>

    <p>"A&mdash;a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact business if I am confused? Let us be
    clear-headed. If you could kindly mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many shillings in
    twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind."</p>

    <p>Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had very gently raised her, and the hands
    that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she communicated some
    reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.</p>

    <p>"That's right, that's right. Courage! Business! You have business before you; useful business. Miss Manette, your
    mother took this course with you. And when she died&mdash;I believe broken-hearted&mdash;having never slackened her
    unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy,
    without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison, or
    wasted there through many lingering years."</p>

    <p>As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to
    himself that it might have been already tinged with grey.</p>

    <p>"You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what they had was secured to your mother and to
    you. There has been no new discovery, of money, or of any other property; but&mdash;"</p>

    <p>He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the forehead, which had so particularly
    attracted his notice, and which was now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.</p>

    <p>"But he has been&mdash;been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too probable; almost a wreck, it is
    possible; though we will hope the best. Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in
    Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to restore him to life, love, duty, rest,
    comfort."</p>

    <p>A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said, in a low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if
    she were saying it in a dream,</p>

    <p>"I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost&mdash;not him!"</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. "There, there, there! See now, see now! The best and the
    worst are known to you, now. You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair sea voyage,
    and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side."</p>

    <p>She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, "I have been free, I have been happy, yet his Ghost has never
    haunted me!"</p>

    <p>"Only one thing more," said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention: "he
    has been found under another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be worse than useless now to
    inquire which; worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly
    held prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries, because it would be dangerous. Better not
    to mention the subject, anywhere or in any way, and to remove him&mdash;for a while at all events&mdash;out of
    France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even Tellson's, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming
    of the matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring to it. This is a secret service altogether.
    My credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, 'Recalled to Life;' which may mean
    anything. But what is the matter! She doesn't notice a word! Miss Manette!"</p>
