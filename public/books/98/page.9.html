    <p>And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance,
    the darkness of it was heavy&mdash;cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in waiting on the
    saintly presence&mdash;nobles of great power all of them; but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that
    had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground
    old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered
    in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which had worked them down, was the mill that grinds
    young people old; the children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown faces, and
    ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh, was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger
    was pushed out of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and lines; Hunger was patched into
    them with straw and rag and wood and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood
    that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that
    had no offal, among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the baker's shelves, written in
    every small loaf of his scanty stock of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that was
    offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred
    into atomics in every farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant drops of oil.</p>

    <p>Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding street, full of offence and stench, with other
    narrow winding streets diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags and nightcaps, and all
    visible things with a brooding look upon them that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some
    wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and slinking though they were, eyes of fire were
    not wanting among them; nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted into the
    likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many
    as the shops) were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman painted up, only the leanest scrags
    of meat; the baker, the coarsest of meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops, croaked
    over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was
    represented in a flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler's knives and axes were sharp and
    bright, the smith's hammers were heavy, and the gunmaker's stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the
    pavement, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off abruptly at the doors.
    The kennel, to make amends, ran down the middle of the street&mdash;when it ran at all: which was only after heavy
    rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy
    lamp was slung by a rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted, and hoisted
    them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were
    at sea, and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.</p>

    <p>For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region should have watched the lamplighter, in their
    idleness and hunger, so long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling up men by those ropes
    and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew
    over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of song and feather, took no warning.</p>

    <p>The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its appearance and degree, and the master of the
    wine-shop had stood outside it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle for the lost
    wine. "It's not my affair," said he, with a final shrug of the shoulders. "The people from the market did it. Let
    them bring another."</p>

    <p>There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke, he called to him across the way:</p>

    <p>"Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?"</p>

    <p>The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often the way with his tribe. It missed its mark,
    and completely failed, as is often the way with his tribe too.</p>

    <p>"What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?" said the wine-shop keeper, crossing the road, and
    obliterating the jest with a handful of mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. "Why do you write in
    the public streets? Is there&mdash;tell me thou&mdash;is there no other place to write such words in?"</p>

    <p>In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally, perhaps not) upon the joker's heart. The
    joker rapped it with his own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing attitude, with one
    of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly
    practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.</p>

    <p>"Put it on, put it on," said the other. "Call wine, wine; and finish there." With that advice, he wiped his
    soiled hand upon the joker's dress, such as it was&mdash;quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on his
    account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.</p>

    <p>This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty, and he should have been of a hot
    temperament, for, although it was a bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder. His
    shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on
    his head than his own crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good eyes and a good bold
    breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong
    resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side,
    for nothing would turn the man.</p>

    <p>Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of
    about his own age, with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand heavily ringed, a steady
    face, strong features, and great composure of manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one
    might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself in any of the reckonings over which she
    presided. Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright shawl twined
    about her head, though not to the concealment of her large earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid
    it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported by her left hand, Madame
    Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the
    lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her husband that he
    would do well to look round the shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped
    over the way.</p>
