    <p>Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau preceded, went from his carriage,
    sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable
    building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau
    held at the great door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being in the open night-air.
    Other sound than the owl's voice there was none, save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was
    one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then heave a long low sigh, and hold their
    breath again.</p>

    <p>The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears,
    swords, and knives of the chase; grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a peasant,
    gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord was angry.</p>

    <p>Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night, Monsieur the Marquis, with his
    flambeau-bearer going on before, went up the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him to
    his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted
    floors, great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries befitting the state of
    a marquis in a luxurious age and country. The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to
    break&mdash;the fourteenth Louis&mdash;was conspicuous in their rich furniture; but, it was diversified by many
    objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of France.</p>

    <p>A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round room, in one of the chateau's four
    extinguisher-topped towers. A small lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds closed, so
    that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of black, alternating with their broad lines of stone
    colour.</p>

    <p>"My nephew," said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; "they said he was not arrived."</p>

    <p>Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.</p>

    <p>"Ah! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the table as it is. I shall be ready in a
    quarter of an hour."</p>

    <p>In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his sumptuous and choice supper. His chair
    was opposite to the window, and he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his lips, when he
    put it down.</p>

    <p>"What is that?" he calmly asked, looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour.</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur? That?"</p>

    <p>"Outside the blinds. Open the blinds."</p>

    <p>It was done.</p>

    <p>"Well?"</p>

    <p>"Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are here."</p>

    <p>The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into the vacant darkness, and stood with that
    blank behind him, looking round for instructions.</p>

    <p>"Good," said the imperturbable master. "Close them again."</p>

    <p>That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was half way through it, when he again stopped
    with his glass in his hand, hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the front of the
    chateau.</p>

    <p>"Ask who is arrived."</p>

    <p>It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had
    diminished the distance rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road. He had heard of
    Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.</p>

    <p>He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and there, and that he was prayed to come to
    it. In a little while he came. He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.</p>

    <p>Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake hands.</p>

    <p>"You left Paris yesterday, sir?" he said to Monseigneur, as he took his seat at table.</p>

    <p>"Yesterday. And you?"</p>

    <p>"I come direct."</p>

    <p>"From London?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"You have been a long time coming," said the Marquis, with a smile.</p>

    <p>"On the contrary; I come direct."</p>

    <p>"Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time intending the journey."</p>

    <p>"I have been detained by"&mdash;the nephew stopped a moment in his answer&mdash;"various business."</p>

    <p>"Without doubt," said the polished uncle.</p>

    <p>So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them. When coffee had been served and they were
    alone together, the nephew, looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask, opened
    a conversation.</p>

    <p>"I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that took me away. It carried me into great and
    unexpected peril; but it is a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained
    me."</p>

    <p>"Not to death," said the uncle; "it is not necessary to say, to death."</p>

    <p>"I doubt, sir," returned the nephew, "whether, if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death, you would have
    cared to stop me there."</p>

    <p>The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face, looked ominous
    as to that; the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that
    it was not reassuring.</p>

    <p>"Indeed, sir," pursued the nephew, "for anything I know, you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious
    appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me."</p>

    <p>"No, no, no," said the uncle, pleasantly.</p>

    <p>"But, however that may be," resumed the nephew, glancing at him with deep distrust, "I know that your diplomacy
    would stop me by any means, and would know no scruple as to means."</p>

    <p>"My friend, I told you so," said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the two marks. "Do me the favour to recall
    that I told you so, long ago."</p>

    <p>"I recall it."</p>

    <p>"Thank you," said the Marquis&mdash;very sweetly indeed.</p>

    <p>His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical instrument.</p>

    <p>"In effect, sir," pursued the nephew, "I believe it to be at once your bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has
    kept me out of a prison in France here."</p>

    <p>"I do not quite understand," returned the uncle, sipping his coffee. "Dare I ask you to explain?"</p>

    <p>"I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years
    past, a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely."</p>

    <p>"It is possible," said the uncle, with great calmness. "For the honour of the family, I could even resolve to
    incommode you to that extent. Pray excuse me!"</p>
