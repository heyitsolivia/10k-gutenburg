    <p>He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so touching, yet so terrible in the
    tremendous wrong and suffering which had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.</p>

    <p>When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded
    to the calm that must follow all storms&mdash;emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm
    called Life must hush at last&mdash;they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground. He had
    gradually dropped to the floor, and lay there in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his head
    might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained him from the light.</p>

    <p>"If, without disturbing him," she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as he stooped over them, after repeated
    blowings of his nose, "all could be arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he could be
    taken away&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"But, consider. Is he fit for the journey?" asked Mr. Lorry.</p>

    <p>"More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to him."</p>

    <p>"It is true," said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. "More than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all
    reasons, best out of France. Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?"</p>

    <p>"That's business," said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his methodical manners; "and if business is to
    be done, I had better do it."</p>

    <p>"Then be so kind," urged Miss Manette, "as to leave us here. You see how composed he has become, and you cannot
    be afraid to leave him with me now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption, I
    do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back, as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of
    him until you return, and then we will remove him straight."</p>

    <p>Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and in favour of one of them remaining. But,
    as there were not only carriage and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed, for the day
    was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and
    hurrying away to do it.</p>

    <p>Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the hard ground close at the father's side,
    and watched him. The darkness deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed through the
    chinks in the wall.</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and had brought with them, besides travelling
    cloaks and wrappers, bread and meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the lamp he
    carried, on the shoemaker's bench (there was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry
    roused the captive, and assisted him to his feet.</p>

    <p>No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether
    he knew what had happened, whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that he was free, were
    questions which no sagacity could have solved. They tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow
    to answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for the time to tamper with him no more. He had a
    wild, lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen in him before; yet, he had
    some pleasure in the mere sound of his daughter's voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.</p>

    <p>In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he ate and drank what they gave him to eat
    and drink, and put on the cloak and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily responded to his
    daughter's drawing her arm through his, and took&mdash;and kept&mdash;her hand in both his own.</p>

    <p>They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr. Lorry closing the little procession. They
    had not traversed many steps of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and round at the
    walls.</p>

    <p>"You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?"</p>

    <p>"What did you say?"</p>

    <p>But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if she had repeated it.</p>

    <p>"Remember? No, I don't remember. It was so very long ago."</p>

    <p>That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his prison to that house, was apparent to
    them. They heard him mutter, "One Hundred and Five, North Tower;" and when he looked about him, it evidently was for
    the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed him. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered
    his tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage
    waiting in the open street, he dropped his daughter's hand and clasped his head again.</p>

    <p>No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the many windows; not even a chance passerby
    was in the street. An unnatural silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and that was
    Madame Defarge&mdash;who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.</p>

    <p>The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed him, when Mr. Lorry's feet were arrested on the
    step by his asking, miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame Defarge immediately called
    to her husband that she would get them, and went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly
    brought them down and handed them in;&mdash;and immediately afterwards leaned against the door-post, knitting, and
    saw nothing.</p>

    <p>Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word "To the Barrier!" The postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered
    away under the feeble over-swinging lamps.</p>

    <p>Under the over-swinging lamps&mdash;swinging ever brighter in the better streets, and ever dimmer in the
    worse&mdash;and by lighted shops, gay crowds, illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city
    gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. "Your papers, travellers!" "See here then, Monsieur the
    Officer," said Defarge, getting down, and taking him gravely apart, "these are the papers of monsieur inside, with
    the white head. They were consigned to me, with him, at the&mdash;" He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among
    the military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform, the eyes connected with the
    arm looked, not an every day or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. "It is well. Forward!" from
    the uniform. "Adieu!" from Defarge. And so, under a short grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out
    under the great grove of stars.</p>
