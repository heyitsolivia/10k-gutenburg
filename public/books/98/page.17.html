    <p>The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson's establishment was put through the door,
    and the word was given:</p>

    <p>"Porter wanted!"</p>

    <p>"Hooray, father! Here's an early job to begin with!"</p>

    <p>Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on the stool, entered on his reversionary
    interest in the straw his father had been chewing, and cogitated.</p>

    <p>"Al-ways rusty! His fingers is al-ways rusty!" muttered young Jerry. "Where does my father get all that iron rust
    from? He don't get no iron rust here!"</p>

    <p>"You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?" said one of the oldest of clerks to Jerry the messenger.</p>

    <p>"Ye-es, sir," returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. "I <em>do</em> know the Bailey."</p>

    <p>"Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry."</p>

    <p>"I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much better," said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant
    witness at the establishment in question, "than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey."</p>

    <p>"Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will
    then let you in."</p>

    <p>"Into the court, sir?"</p>

    <p>"Into the court."</p>

    <p>Mr. Cruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to interchange the inquiry, "What do you
    think of this?"</p>

    <p>"Am I to wait in the court, sir?" he asked, as the result of that conference.</p>

    <p>"I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr. Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will
    attract Mr. Lorry's attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is, to remain there until he
    wants you."</p>

    <p>"Is that all, sir?"</p>

    <p>"That's all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him you are there."</p>

    <p>As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note, Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence
    until he came to the blotting-paper stage, remarked:</p>

    <p>"I suppose they'll be trying Forgeries this morning?"</p>

    <p>"Treason!"</p>

    <p>"That's quartering," said Jerry. "Barbarous!"</p>

    <p>"It is the law," remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised spectacles upon him. "It is the law."</p>

    <p>"It's hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It's hard enough to kill him, but it's wery hard to spile him,
    sir."</p>

    <p>"Not at all," retained the ancient clerk. "Speak well of the law. Take care of your chest and voice, my good
    friend, and leave the law to take care of itself. I give you that advice."</p>

    <p>"It's the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice," said Jerry. "I leave you to judge what a damp way of
    earning a living mine is."</p>

    <p>"Well, well," said the old clerk; "we all have our various ways of gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp
    ways, and some of us have dry ways. Here is the letter. Go along."</p>

    <p>Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal deference than he made an outward show of,
    "You are a lean old one, too," made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination, and went his
    way.</p>

    <p>They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that
    has since attached to it. But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were
    practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight
    from the dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It had more than once happened, that
    the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner's, and even died before him. For the
    rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard, from which pale travellers set out continually, in
    carts and coaches, on a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a half of public street
    and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any. So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the
    beginning. It was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted a punishment of which no one
    could foresee the extent; also, for the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and softening
    to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom,
    systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under Heaven. Altogether, the
    Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice illustration of the precept, that "Whatever is is right;" an aphorism that
    would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome consequence, that nothing that ever was, was
    wrong.</p>

    <p>Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this hideous scene of action, with the skill of a
    man accustomed to make his way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in his letter through
    a trap in it. For, people then paid to see the play at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in
    Bedlam&mdash;only the former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey doors were well
    guarded&mdash;except, indeed, the social doors by which the criminals got there, and those were always left wide
    open.</p>

    <p>After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry
    Cruncher to squeeze himself into court.</p>

    <p>"What's on?" he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next to.</p>

    <p>"Nothing yet."</p>

    <p>"What's coming on?"</p>

    <p>"The Treason case."</p>

    <p>"The quartering one, eh?"</p>

    <p>"Ah!" returned the man, with a relish; "he'll be drawn on a hurdle to be half hanged, and then he'll be taken
    down and sliced before his own face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on, and then his
    head will be chopped off, and he'll be cut into quarters. That's the sentence."</p>

    <p>"If he's found Guilty, you mean to say?" Jerry added, by way of proviso.</p>

    <p>"Oh! they'll find him guilty," said the other. "Don't you be afraid of that."</p>

    <p>Mr. Cruncher's attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the
    note in his hand. Mr. Lorry sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged gentleman, the
    prisoner's counsel, who had a great bundle of papers before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with
    his hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be
    concentrated on the ceiling of the court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing with his
    hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down
    again.</p>
