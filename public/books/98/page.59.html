    <p>He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had done so, whether he was not still asleep. For,
    going to the door of the Doctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench and tools were put
    aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face
    (which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly studious and attentive.</p>

    <p>Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments
    whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his friend
    before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range,
    that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?</p>

    <p>It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the answer being obvious. If the impression were
    not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there? How came he to have
    fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points
    outside the Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning?</p>

    <p>Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he had had any particle of doubt left, her talk
    would of necessity have resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none. He advised that they should
    let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had
    occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr. Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek
    direction and guidance from the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.</p>

    <p>Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked out with care. Having abundance of time for
    his usual methodical toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen, and with
    his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the usual way, and came to breakfast.</p>

    <p>So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr.
    Lorry felt to be the only safe advance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken place yesterday.
    An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and
    counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however, he was so composedly himself, that Mr.
    Lorry determined to have the aid he sought. And that aid was his own.</p>

    <p>Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry
    said, feelingly:</p>

    <p>"My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a very curious case in which I am deeply
    interested; that is to say, it is very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less so."</p>

    <p>Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the Doctor looked troubled, and listened
    attentively. He had already glanced at his hands more than once.</p>

    <p>"Doctor Manette," said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the arm, "the case is the case of a particularly
    dear friend of mine. Pray give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake&mdash;and above all, for his
    daughter's&mdash;his daughter's, my dear Manette."</p>

    <p>"If I understand," said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, "some mental shock&mdash;?"</p>

    <p>"Yes!"</p>

    <p>"Be explicit," said the Doctor. "Spare no detail."</p>

    <p>Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.</p>

    <p>"My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock, of great acuteness and severity to the
    affections, the feelings, the&mdash;the&mdash;as you express it&mdash;the mind. The mind. It is the case of a shock
    under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time
    himself, and there are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered,
    by a process that he cannot trace himself&mdash;as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is the
    case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close
    application of mind, and great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge,
    which was already very large. But, unfortunately, there has been," he paused and took a deep breath&mdash;"a slight
    relapse."</p>

    <p>The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, "Of how long duration?"</p>

    <p>"Nine days and nights."</p>

    <p>"How did it show itself? I infer," glancing at his hands again, "in the resumption of some old pursuit connected
    with the shock?"</p>

    <p>"That is the fact."</p>

    <p>"Now, did you ever see him," asked the Doctor, distinctly and collectedly, though in the same low voice, "engaged
    in that pursuit originally?"</p>

    <p>"Once."</p>

    <p>"And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects&mdash;or in all respects&mdash;as he was then?"</p>

    <p>"I think in all respects."</p>

    <p>"You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?"</p>

    <p>"No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her. It is known only to myself, and to one
    other who may be trusted."</p>

    <p>The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, "That was very kind. That was very thoughtful!" Mr. Lorry grasped his
    hand in return, and neither of the two spoke for a little while.</p>

    <p>"Now, my dear Manette," said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most considerate and most affectionate way, "I am a
    mere man of business, and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not possess the kind of
    information necessary; I do not possess the kind of intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on
    whom I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this relapse come about? Is there danger of
    another? Could a repetition of it be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come about at
    all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am
    to serve mine, if I knew how.</p>

    <p>"But I don't know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity, knowledge, and experience, could put me on
    the right track, I might be able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little. Pray discuss it
    with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly, and teach me how to be a little more useful."</p>

    <p>Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and Mr. Lorry did not press him.</p>

    <p>"I think it probable," said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort, "that the relapse you have described, my
    dear friend, was not quite unforeseen by its subject."</p>
