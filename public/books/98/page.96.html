    <p>"There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention, for I had seen common people struck more
    commonly than dogs. But, the other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner with his arm; the
    look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin
    brothers.</p>

    <p>"From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found locked, and which one of the brothers had
    opened to admit us, and had relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I was conducted to this
    chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the
    brain, lying on a bed.</p>

    <p>"The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much past twenty. Her hair was torn and
    ragged, and her arms were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these bonds were all
    portions of a gentleman's dress. On one of them, which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the
    armorial bearings of a Noble, and the letter E.</p>

    <p>"I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient; for, in her restless strivings she had
    turned over on her face on the edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was in danger of
    suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the
    embroidery in the corner caught my sight.</p>

    <p>"I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down, and looked into her
    face. Her eyes were dilated and wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the words, 'My
    husband, my father, and my brother!' and then counted up to twelve, and said, 'Hush!' For an instant, and no more,
    she would pause to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she would repeat the cry, 'My
    husband, my father, and my brother!' and would count up to twelve, and say, 'Hush!' There was no variation in the
    order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular moment's pause, in the utterance of these sounds.</p>

    <p>"'How long,' I asked, 'has this lasted?'</p>

    <p>"To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised
    the most authority. It was the elder who replied, 'Since about this hour last night.'</p>

    <p>"'She has a husband, a father, and a brother?'</p>

    <p>"'A brother.'</p>

    <p>"'I do not address her brother?'</p>

    <p>"He answered with great contempt, 'No.'</p>

    <p>"'She has some recent association with the number twelve?'</p>

    <p>"The younger brother impatiently rejoined, 'With twelve o'clock?'</p>

    <p>"'See, gentlemen,' said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, 'how useless I am, as you have brought me! If
    I had known what I was coming to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost. There are no
    medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.'</p>

    <p>"The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, 'There is a case of medicines here;' and brought it
    from a closet, and put it on the table.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>"I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my lips. If I had wanted to use anything save
    narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.</p>

    <p>"'Do you doubt them?' asked the younger brother.</p>

    <p>"'You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,' I replied, and said no more.</p>

    <p>"I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many efforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I
    intended to repeat it after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then sat down by the side of
    the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into
    a corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently furnished&mdash;evidently, recently occupied and temporarily
    used. Some thick old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the sound of the shrieks. They
    continued to be uttered in their regular succession, with the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' the
    counting up to twelve, and 'Hush!' The frenzy was so violent, that I had not unfastened the bandages restraining the
    arms; but, I had looked to them, to see that they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement in the case,
    was, that my hand upon the sufferer's breast had this much soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it
    tranquillised the figure. It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more regular.</p>

    <p>"For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour, with
    the two brothers looking on, before the elder said:</p>

    <p>"'There is another patient.'</p>

    <p>"I was startled, and asked, 'Is it a pressing case?'</p>

    <p>"'You had better see,' he carelessly answered; and took up a light.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>"The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which was a species of loft over a stable. There
    was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and there were beams
    across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I
    had to pass through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial and unshaken. I try it with these
    details, and I see them all, in this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my captivity, as I
    saw them all that night.</p>

    <p>"On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a handsome peasant boy&mdash;a boy of not
    more than seventeen at the most. He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his breast, and
    his glaring eyes looking straight upward. I could not see where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him;
    but, I could see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.</p>

    <p>"'I am a doctor, my poor fellow,' said I. 'Let me examine it.'</p>

    <p>"'I do not want it examined,' he answered; 'let it be.'</p>

    <p>"It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away. The wound was a sword-thrust, received
    from twenty to twenty-four hours before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay.
    He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose
    life was ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all as if he were a
    fellow-creature.</p>

    <p>"'How has this been done, monsieur?' said I.</p>

    <p>"'A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw upon him, and has fallen by my brother's
    sword&mdash;like a gentleman.'</p>

    <p>"There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that
    it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would have been better if he
    had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about
    the boy, or about his fate.</p>
