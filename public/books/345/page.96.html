    <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining. Great big fat ones with
    steel and sapphire on their wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their backs.&rdquo; Van
    Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The <em>Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges</em>&mdash;what you call the ‘Death&rsquo;s-head Moth&rsquo;?&rdquo; The patient went
    on without stopping.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Then he began to whisper: ‘Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands, millions of them, and every one a life; and
    dogs to eat them, and cats too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely buzzing flies!&rsquo; I
    laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do. Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house.
    He beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his hands, and seemed to call out without using
    any words. A dark mass spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and then He moved the
    mist to the right and left, and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red&mdash;like
    His, only smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he seemed to be saying: ‘All these lives
    will I give you, ay, and many more and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship me!&rsquo; And
    then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I
    found myself opening the sash and saying to Him: ‘Come in, Lord and Master!&rsquo; The rats were all gone, but He slid
    into the room through the sash, though it was only open an inch wide&mdash;just as the Moon herself has often come
    in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and he continued; but it seemed as though
    his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him back to
    the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: &ldquo;Let him go on. Do not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could
    not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought.&rdquo; He proceeded:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not even a blow-fly, and when the moon got
    up I was pretty angry with him. When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even knock, I
    got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked out of the mist
    with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he owned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn&rsquo;t even
    smell the same as he went by me. I couldn&rsquo;t hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs. Harker had come into the
    room.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind him so that he could not see them, but
    where they could hear better. They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face, however, grew
    grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without noticing:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn&rsquo;t the same; it was like tea after the teapot had been
    watered.&rdquo; Here we all moved, but no one said a word; he went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn&rsquo;t look the same. I don&rsquo;t care for the pale people;
    I like them with lots of blood in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn&rsquo;t think of it at the time;
    but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad to know that He had been taking the life out of her.&rdquo; I
    could feel that the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. &ldquo;So when He came to-night I was ready
    for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and as
    I knew I was a madman&mdash;at times anyhow&mdash;I resolved to use my power. Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to
    come out of the mist to struggle with me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn&rsquo;t mean Him to
    take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned into me, and my strength became like water. He slipped
    through it, and when I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There was a red cloud before me,
    and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed to steal away under the door.&rdquo; His voice was becoming fainter and his
    breath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We know the worst now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is here, and we know his purpose. It may not be too late. Let us be
    armed&mdash;the same as we were the other night, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.&rdquo; There was no
    need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words&mdash;we shared them in common. We all hurried and took from
    our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the Count&rsquo;s house. The Professor had his ready, and as we met
    in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is over.
    Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with. Alas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should
    suffer!&rdquo; He stopped; his voice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart.</p>

    <p>Outside the Harkers&rsquo; door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the latter said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Should we disturb her?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We must,&rdquo; said Van Helsing grimly. &ldquo;If the door be locked, I shall break it in.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady&rsquo;s room!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Van Helsing said solemnly, &ldquo;You are always right; but this is life and death. All chambers are alike to the
    doctor; and even were they not they are all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if the door
    does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you too, my friends. Now!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw ourselves against it; with a crash it
    burst open, and we almost fell headlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw across him as he
    gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw appalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of
    my neck, and my heart seemed to stand still.</p>
