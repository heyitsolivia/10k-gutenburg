    <p>&ldquo;‘Wilhelmina&rsquo;&mdash;I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has never called me by that name
    since he asked me to marry him&mdash;‘you know, dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should
    be no secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to think of what it is I feel my head spin
    round, and I do not know if it was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain fever, and that
    is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.&rsquo;
    For, my dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete. ‘Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to
    share my ignorance? Here is the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me know; unless,
    indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded
    here.&rsquo; He fell back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I have asked Sister Agatha to
    beg the Superior to let our wedding be this afternoon, and am waiting her reply....</p>

    
    <p>&ldquo;She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission church has been sent for. We are to be married
    in an hour, or as soon after as Jonathan awakes....</p>

    
    <p>&ldquo;Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very happy. Jonathan woke a little after the
    hour, and all was ready, and he sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. He answered his ‘I will&rsquo; firmly and
    strongly. I could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me. The dear sisters were
    so kind. Please God, I shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities I have taken upon
    me. I must tell you of my wedding present. When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my
    husband&mdash;oh, Lucy, it is the first time I have written the words ‘my husband&rsquo;&mdash;left me alone with my
    husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it up in white paper, and tied it<a name="page_100"
    id="page_100"></a> with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with
    sealing-wax, and for my seal I used my wedding ring. Then I kissed it and showed it to my husband, and told him that
    I would keep it so, and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each
    other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he
    took my hand in his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took <em>his wife&rsquo;s</em> hand, and said that it was the
    dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor
    dear meant to have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I shall not wonder if at first he
    mixes up not only the month, but the year.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the happiest woman in all the wide world, and
    that I had nothing to give him except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love and duty for
    all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me, and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a
    very solemn pledge between us....</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because it is all sweet to me, but because you
    have been, and are, very dear to me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the
    schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now, and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither
    duty has led me; so that in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear, please Almighty God,
    your life may be all it promises: a long day of sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I
    must not wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be <em>always</em> as happy as I am
    <em>now</em>. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop, for
    Jonathan is waking&mdash;I must attend to my husband!</p>

    <p class="nind">&ldquo;My dearest Mina,&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own home with your husband. I wish you could
    be coming home soon enough to stay with us here. The strong air would soon restore Jonathan; it has quite restored
    me. I have an appetite like a cormorant, am full of life, and sleep well. You
    will be glad to know that I have quite given up walking in my sleep. I think I have not stirred out of my bed for a
    week, that is when I once got into it at night. Arthur says I am getting fat. By the way, I forgot to tell you that
    Arthur is here. We have such walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing together; and I love
    him more than ever. He <em>tells</em> me that he loves me more, but I doubt that, for at first he told me that he
    couldn&rsquo;t love me more than he did then. But this is nonsense. There he is, calling to me. So no more just at present
    from your loving</p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lucy.</span></p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>20 August.</em>&mdash;The case of Renfield grows even more interesting. He has now so far quieted that there
    are spells of cessation from his passion. For the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent. Then one
    night, just as the moon rose, he grew quiet, and kept murmuring to himself: &ldquo;Now I can wait; now I can wait.&rdquo; The
    attendant came to tell me, so I ran down at once to have a look at him. He was still in the strait-waistcoat and in
    the padded room, but the suffused look had gone from his face, and his eyes had something of their old
    pleading&mdash;I might almost say, &ldquo;cringing&rdquo;&mdash;softness. I was satisfied with his present condition, and
    directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated, but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a
    strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for, coming close to me, he said in a
    whisper, all the while looking furtively at them:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;They think I could hurt you! Fancy <em>me</em> hurting <em>you</em>! The fools!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from
    the others; but all the same I do not follow his thought. Am I to take it that I have anything in common with him,
    so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well-being
    is needful to him? I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the offer of a kitten or even a
    full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will only say: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,
    and I can wait; I can wait.&rdquo;</p>
