    <p>I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down a rule that she should not be present
    with Lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that I saw
    again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were shown up to Lucy&rsquo;s room. If I was shocked when I
    saw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the red seemed to have
    gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see
    or hear. Van Helsing&rsquo;s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose.
    Lucy lay motionless, and did not seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then Van Helsing
    beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the
    passage to the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he
    said; &ldquo;this is dreadful. There is no time to be lost. She will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart&rsquo;s
    action as it should be. There must be transfusion of blood at once. Is it you or me?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am younger and stronger, Professor. It must be me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Then get ready at once. I will bring up my bag. I am prepared.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was a knock at the hall-door. When we reached the hall the
    maid had just opened the door, and Arthur was stepping quickly in. He rushed up to me, saying in an eager
    whisper:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Jack, I was so anxious. I read between the lines of your letter, and have been in an agony. The dad was better,
    so I ran down here to see for myself. Is not that gentleman Dr. Van Helsing? I
    am so thankful to you, sir, for coming.&rdquo; When first the Professor&rsquo;s eye had lit upon him he had been angry at his
    interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood
    which seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. Without a pause he said to him gravely as he held out his
    hand:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do
    not go like that.&rdquo; For he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. &ldquo;You are to help her. You can
    do more than any that live, and your courage is your best help.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; asked Arthur hoarsely. &ldquo;Tell me, and I shall do it. My life is hers, and I would give the last
    drop of blood in my body for her.&rdquo; The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old knowledge detect
    a trace of its origin in his answer:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My young sir, I do not ask so much as that&mdash;not the last!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril quivered with intent. Van Helsing slapped him
    on the shoulder. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are a man, and it is a man we want. You are better than me, better than my
    friend John.&rdquo; Arthur looked bewildered, and the Professor went on by explaining in a kindly way:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Young miss is bad, very bad. She wants blood, and blood she must have or die. My friend John and I have
    consulted; and we are about to perform what we call transfusion of blood&mdash;to transfer from full veins of one to
    the empty veins which pine for him. John was to give his blood, as he is the more young and strong than
    me&rdquo;&mdash;here Arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silence&mdash;&ldquo;but, now you are here, you are more good than
    us, old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not so calm and our blood not so bright than
    yours!&rdquo; Arthur turned to him and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo; said Van Helsing. &ldquo;In the not-so-far-off you will be happy that you have done all for her you love.
    Come now and be silent. You shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you must leave at my
    sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be
    one. Come!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>We all went up to Lucy&rsquo;s room. Arthur by direction remained outside. Lucy
    turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the
    effort. Her eyes spoke to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little
    table out of sight. Then he mixed a narcotic, and coming over to the bed, said cheerily:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Now, little miss, here is your medicine. Drink it off, like a good child. See, I lift you so that to swallow is
    easy. Yes.&rdquo; She had made the effort with success.</p>

    <p>It astonished me how long the drug took to act. This, in fact, marked the extent of her weakness. The time seemed
    endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids. At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest its potency;
    and she fell into a deep sleep. When the Professor was satisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip
    off his coat. Then he added: &ldquo;You may take that one little kiss whiles I bring over the table. Friend John, help to
    me!&rdquo; So neither of us looked whilst he bent over her.</p>

    <p>Van Helsing turning to me, said:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the operation. As the transfusion went on
    something like life seemed to come back to poor Lucy&rsquo;s cheeks, and through Arthur&rsquo;s growing pallor the joy of his
    face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur,
    strong man as he was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy&rsquo;s system must have undergone that what
    weakened Arthur only partially restored her. But the Professor&rsquo;s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with
    his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own heart beat. Presently he said in a soft
    voice: &ldquo;Do not stir an instant. It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.&rdquo; When all was over I could see how
    much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without
    turning round&mdash;the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:&mdash;</p>
