    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up, she
    seemed brighter and better than she had been for days. At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. Wherever he may
    be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination. To his doom, I trust!</p>

    
    <p><em>26 October.</em>&mdash;Another day and no tidings of the <em>Czarina Catherine</em>. She ought to be here by now.
    That she is still journeying <em>somewhere</em> is apparent, for Mrs. Harker&rsquo;s hypnotic report at sunrise was still
    the same. It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog; some of the steamers which came in last
    evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port. We must continue our watching, as the ship may
    now be signalled any moment.</p>

    
    <p><em>27 October, Noon.</em>&mdash;Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for. Mrs. Harker reported last night
    and this morning as usual: &ldquo;lapping waves and rushing water,&rdquo; though she added that &ldquo;the waves were very faint.&rdquo; The
    telegrams from London have been the same: &ldquo;no further report.&rdquo; Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now
    that he fears the Count is escaping us. He added significantly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina&rsquo;s. Souls and memories can do strange things during trance.&rdquo; I was
    about to ask him more, but Harker just then came in, and he held up a warning hand. We must try to-night at sunset
    to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.</p>

      <p><em>28 October.</em>&mdash;Telegram. <em>Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming, care H. B. M. Vice Consul,
      Varna.</em></p>

      <p>&ldquo;<em>Czarina Catherine</em> reported entering Galatz at one o&rsquo;clock to-day.&rdquo;</p>

    </div>
    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>28 October.</em>&mdash;When the telegram came announcing the arrival in Galatz I do not think it was such a
    shock to any of us as might have been expected. True, we did not know whence, or how, or<a name="page_316"
    id="page_316"></a> when, the bolt would come; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen. The
    delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected; we only
    waited to learn where the change would occur. None the less, however, was it a surprise. I suppose that nature works
    on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should
    know that they will be. Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp to man. It was
    an odd experience and we all took it differently. Van Helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment, as though
    in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set.
    Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. I was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one
    after another. Quincey Morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our old wandering
    days it meant &ldquo;action.&rdquo; Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she
    folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer. Harker smiled&mdash;actually smiled&mdash;the dark, bitter smile of
    one who is without hope; but at the same time his action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the
    hilt of the great Kukri knife and rested there. &ldquo;When does the next train start for Galatz?&rdquo; said Van Helsing to us
    generally.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;At 6:30 to-morrow morning!&rdquo; We all started, for the answer came from Mrs. Harker.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How on earth do you know?&rdquo; said Art.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You forget&mdash;or perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does and so does Dr. Van Helsing&mdash;that I am
    the train fiend. At home in Exeter I always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my husband. I
    found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of the time-tables now. I knew that if anything were to
    take us to Castle Dracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I learned the times very
    carefully. Unhappily there are not many to learn, as the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Wonderful woman!&rdquo; murmured the Professor.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we get a special?&rdquo; asked Lord Godalming. Van Helsing shook his head: &ldquo;I fear not. This land is very
    different from yours or mine; even if we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular
    train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think. Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the
    train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the
    morning. Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him letters to the agent in Galatz, with
    authority to make search the ship just as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get his aid with
    his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way smooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube. John
    will stay with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult. For so if time be long you may be delayed; and it will not
    matter when the sun set, since I am here with Madam to make report.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she had been for many a long day, &ldquo;shall try
    to be of use in all ways, and shall think and write for you as I used to do. Something is shifting from me in some
    strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!&rdquo; The three younger men looked happier at the moment as they
    seemed to realise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to each other, met each a grave and
    troubled glance. We said nothing at the time, however.</p>

    <p>When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs. Harker to look up the copy of the diaries
    and find him the part of Harker&rsquo;s journal at the Castle. She went away to get it; when the door was shut upon her he
    said to me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We mean the same! speak out!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There is some change. It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may deceive us.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Quite so. Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You are in part right, friend John, but only in part. I want to tell you something. And oh, my friend, I am
    taking a great&mdash;a terrible&mdash;risk; but I believe it is right. In the moment when Madam Mina said those
    words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. In the trance of three days ago the Count sent
    her his spirit to read her mind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship with water
    rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. He learn then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her
    open life with eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box. Now he make his most effort
    to escape us. At present he want her not.</p>
