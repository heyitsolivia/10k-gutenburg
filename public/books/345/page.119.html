    
    <p><em>30 October, 7 a. m.</em>&mdash;We are near Galatz now, and I may not have time to write later. Sunrise this
    morning was anxiously looked for by us all. Knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,
    Van Helsing began his passes earlier than usual. They produced no effect, however, until the regular time, when she
    yielded with a still greater difficulty, only a minute before the sun rose. The Professor lost no time in his
    questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;All is dark. I hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the creaking of wood on wood. Cattle low far off.
    There is another sound, a queer one like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped and grew white, and whiter still.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Go on; go on! Speak, I command you!&rdquo; said Van Helsing in an agonised voice. At the same time there was despair
    in his eyes, for the risen sun was reddening even Mrs. Harker&rsquo;s pale face. She opened her eyes, and we all started
    as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, Professor, why ask me to do what you know I can&rsquo;t? I don&rsquo;t remember anything.&rdquo; Then, seeing the look of
    amazement on our faces, she said, turning from one to the other with a troubled look:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What have I said? What have I done? I know nothing, only that I was lying here, half asleep, and heard you say
    go on! speak, I command you!&rsquo; It seemed so funny to hear you order me about, as if I were a bad child!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, Madam Mina,&rdquo; he said, sadly, &ldquo;it is proof, if proof be needed, of how I love and honour you, when a word for
    your good, spoken more earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom I am proud to
    obey!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The whistles are sounding; we are nearing Galatz. We are on fire with anxiety and eagerness.</p>

    <p><em>30 October.</em>&mdash;Mr. Morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been ordered by telegraph, he being
    the one who could best be spared, since he does not speak any foreign language. The<a name="page_325"
    id="page_325"></a> forces were distributed much as they had been at Varna, except that Lord Godalming went to the
    Vice-Consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official, we being in extreme
    hurry. Jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival of the <em>Czarina
    Catherine</em>.</p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;Lord Godalming has returned. The Consul is away, and the Vice-Consul sick; so the routine
    work has been attended to by a clerk. He was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.</p>

    <p><em>30 October.</em>&mdash;At nine o&rsquo;clock Dr. Van Helsing, Dr. Seward, and I called on Messrs. Mackenzie &amp;
    Steinkoff, the agents of the London firm of Hapgood. They had received a wire from London, in answer to Lord
    Godalming&rsquo;s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in their power. They were more than kind and
    courteous, and took us at once on board the <em>Czarina Catherine</em>, which lay at anchor out in the river harbour.
    There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his voyage. He said that in all his life he had never had
    so favourable a run.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Man!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi&rsquo; some rare piece o&rsquo;
    ill luck, so as to keep up the average. It&rsquo;s no canny to run frae London to the Black Sea wi&rsquo; a wind ahint ye, as
    though the Deil himself were blawin&rsquo; on yer sail for his ain purpose. An&rsquo; a&rsquo; the time we could no speer a thing. Gin
    we were nigh a ship, or a port, or a headland, a fog fell on us and travelled wi&rsquo; us, till when after it had lifted
    and we looked out, the deil a thing could we see. We ran by Gibraltar wi&rsquo;oot bein&rsquo; able to signal; an&rsquo; till we came
    to the Dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we never were within hail o&rsquo; aught. At first I
    inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, I thocht that if the Deil was minded
    to get us into the Black Sea quick, he was like to do it whether we would or no. If we had a quick voyage it would
    be no to our miscredit wi&rsquo; the owners, or no hurt to our traffic; an&rsquo; the Old Mon who had served his ain purpose wad
    be decently grateful to us for no hinderin&rsquo; him.&rdquo; This mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition and
    commercial reasoning, aroused Van Helsing, who said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Mine friend, that Devil is more clever than he is thought by some; and he know when he meet his match!&rdquo; The
    skipper was not displeased with the compliment, and went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;When we got past the Bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o&rsquo; them, the Roumanians, came and asked me to
    heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin&rsquo; old man just before we had started frae
    London. I had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa fingers when they saw him, to guard against the
    evil eye. Man! but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! I sent them aboot their business
    pretty quick; but as just after a fog closed in on us I felt a wee bit as they did anent something, though I
    wouldn&rsquo;t say it was agin the big box. Well, on we went, and as the fog didn&rsquo;t let up for five days I joost let the
    wind carry us; for if the Deil wanted to get somewheres&mdash;well, he would fetch it up a&rsquo;reet. An&rsquo; if he didn&rsquo;t,
    well, we&rsquo;d keep a sharp lookout anyhow. Sure eneuch, we had a fair way and deep water all the time; and two days
    ago, when the mornin&rsquo; sun came through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite Galatz. The Roumanians
    were wild, and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling it in the river. I had to argy wi&rsquo; them aboot
    it wi&rsquo; a handspike; an&rsquo; when the last o&rsquo; them rose off the deck wi&rsquo; his head in his hand, I had convinced them that,
    evil eye or no evil eye, the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river Danube.
    They had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to fling in, and as it was marked Galatz <em>via</em> Varna, I
    thocht I&rsquo;d let it lie till we discharged in the port an&rsquo; get rid o&rsquo;t althegither. We didn&rsquo;t do much clearin&rsquo; that
    day, an&rsquo; had to remain the nicht at anchor; but in the mornin&rsquo;, braw an&rsquo; airly, an hour before sun-up, a man came
    aboard wi&rsquo; an order, written to him from England, to receive a box marked for one Count Dracula. Sure eneuch the
    matter was one ready to his hand. He had his papers a&rsquo; reet, an&rsquo; glad I was to be rid o&rsquo; the dam&rsquo; thing, for I was
    beginnin&rsquo; masel&rsquo; to feel uneasy at it. If the Deil did have any luggage aboord the ship, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; it was nane
    ither than that same!&rdquo;</p>
