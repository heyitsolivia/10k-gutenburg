    <p>&ldquo;I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids. Flick them in the face with a wet towel,
    and flick them hard. Make them get heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside
    her. She will need be heated before we can do anything more.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the women. The fourth was only a young girl, and
    the drug had evidently affected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep. The others were
    dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with
    them, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life was bad enough to lose, and that if they
    delayed they would sacrifice Miss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad as they were,
    and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of
    hot water. We got a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst we were busy chafing her limbs
    there was a knock at the hall door. One of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then she
    returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her
    simply tell him that he must wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message, and, engrossed with
    our work, I clean forgot all about him.</p>

    <p>I never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly earnest. I knew&mdash;as he knew&mdash;that it
    was a stand-up fight with death, and in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not understand, but
    with the sternest look that his face could wear:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade away into peace, for I see no light in
    life over her horizon.&rdquo; He went on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.</p>

    <p>Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect. Lucy&rsquo;s heart beat a
    trifle more audibly to the stethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing&rsquo;s face almost beamed,
    and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The first gain is ours! Check to the King!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>We took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of
    brandy down her throat. I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was still
    unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her.</p>

    <p>Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes off her till we
    returned, and then beckoned me out of the room.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We must consult as to what is to be done,&rdquo; he said as we descended the stairs. In the hall he opened the
    dining-room door, and we passed in, he closing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but the
    blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the British woman of the lower classes
    always rigidly observes. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light enough for our purposes. Van
    Helsing&rsquo;s sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about
    something, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have another transfusion of blood, and that soon,
    or that poor girl&rsquo;s life won&rsquo;t be worth an hour&rsquo;s purchase. You are exhausted already; I am exhausted too. I fear to
    trust those women, even if they would have courage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his veins
    for her?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with me, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought relief and joy to my heart, for they were
    those of Quincey Morris. Van Helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a glad look came
    into his eyes as I cried out: &ldquo;Quincey Morris!&rdquo; and rushed towards him with outstretched hands.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What brought you here?&rdquo; I cried as our hands met.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I guess Art is the cause.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He handed me a telegram:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious. Cannot leave. Father still in same
    condition. Send me word how Lucy is. Do not delay.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Holmwood</span>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell me what to do.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Van Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in the eyes as he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A brave man&rsquo;s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble. You&rsquo;re a man and no mistake.
    Well, the devil may work against us for all he&rsquo;s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Once again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart to go through with the details. Lucy had
    got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her veins, her body
    did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions. Her struggle back into life was something
    frightful to see and hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs
    improved, and Van Helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with good effect. Her faint
    became a profound slumber. The Professor watched whilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the
    maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down after having a glass of wine, and
    told the cook to get ready a good breakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where Lucy now
    was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or two of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read
    it, and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look of grim satisfaction in his face,
    as of one who has had a doubt solved. He handed me the paper saying only: &ldquo;It dropped from Lucy&rsquo;s breast when we
    carried her to the bath.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause asked him: &ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, what does it
    all mean? Was she, or is she, mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?&rdquo; I was so bewildered that I did not know
    what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the paper, saying:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know and understand it all in good time; but
    it will be later. And now what is it that you came to me to say?&rdquo; This brought me back to fact, and I was all myself
    again.</p>
