    <p>&ldquo;Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed, it was no wonder that my friends were
    alarmed, and insisted on my being put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity,
    and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely
    prolong life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to take human life. The doctor here will
    bear me out that on one occasion I tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the
    assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his blood&mdash;relying, of course, upon the
    Scriptural phrase, ‘For the blood is the life.&rsquo; Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the
    truism to the very point of contempt. Isn&rsquo;t that true, doctor?&rdquo; I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly
    knew what to either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five
    minutes before. Looking at my watch, I saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.
    Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: &ldquo;Good-bye, and I hope I
    may see you often, under auspices pleasanter to yourself,&rdquo; to which, to my astonishment, he replied:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again. May He bless and keep you!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he
    has been since Lucy first took ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for many a long
    day.</p>

    <p>Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me,
    saying:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come here to stay if need be. All affairs are
    settled with me, and I have much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And Arthur and my
    friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own diary had come to be of some use through
    Mrs. Harker&rsquo;s suggestion; at which the Professor interrupted me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man&rsquo;s brain&mdash;a brain that a man should have were he much
    gifted&mdash;and a woman&rsquo;s heart. The good God fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good
    combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help to us;
    after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We
    men are determined&mdash;nay, are we not pledged?&mdash;to destroy this monster; but it is no part for a woman. Even
    if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer&mdash;both
    in waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides, she is young woman and not so long married;
    there may be other things to think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she must consult
    with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and we go alone.&rdquo; I agreed heartily with him, and then I told
    him what we had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was the very next one to my own. He
    was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on him. &ldquo;Oh that we had known it before!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for then we might
    have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, ‘the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards,&rsquo; as you say.
    We shall not think of that, but go on our way to the end.&rdquo; Then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered
    my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have put up in exact order all things that
    have been, up to this moment.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Not up to this moment, Professor,&rdquo; she said impulsively, &ldquo;but up to this morning.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the little things have made. We have told our
    secrets, and yet no one who has told is the worse for it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It is my record of to-day. I too have seen
    the need of putting down at present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except what is
    personal. Must it go in?&rdquo; The Professor read it over gravely, and handed it back, saying:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can but make your husband love you the more,
    and all us, your friends, more honour you&mdash;as well as more esteem and love.&rdquo; She took it back with another
    blush and a bright smile.</p>

    <p>And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete and in order. The Professor took away one
    copy to study after dinner, and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine
    o&rsquo;clock. The rest of us have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all be informed as to
    facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Mina Harker&rsquo;s Journal.</em></p>

    <p><em>30 September.</em>&mdash;When we met in Dr. Seward&rsquo;s study two hours after dinner, which had been at six
    o&rsquo;clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to
    which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit next to him on his right, and asked me to act
    as secretary; Jonathan sat next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr. Morris&mdash;Lord
    Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the centre. The Professor said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts that are in these papers.&rdquo; We all expressed
    assent, and he went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal. I shall
    then make known to you something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me. So we then can
    discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure according.</p>
