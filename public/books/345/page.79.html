    <p>&ldquo;For dear Lucy&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; I said as we clasped hands. &ldquo;Ay, and for your own sake,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;for if a man&rsquo;s esteem
    and gratitude are ever worth the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring to you a time
    when you need a man&rsquo;s help, believe me, you will not call in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you
    to break the sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you will let me know.&rdquo; He was so
    earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that I felt it would comfort him, so I said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window. He turned as he heard my footsteps. &ldquo;How
    is Art?&rdquo; he said. Then noticing my red eyes, he went on: &ldquo;Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor old fellow!
    he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort
    him.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the manuscript in his hand, and I knew that
    when he read it he would realise how much I knew; so I said to him:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me be your friend, and will you come to me
    for comfort if you need it? You will know, later on, why I speak.&rdquo; He saw that I was in earnest, and stooping, took
    my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and
    impulsively I bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a momentary choking in his throat;
    he said quite calmly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long as ever you live!&rdquo; Then he went into the
    study to his friend.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Little girl!&rdquo;&mdash;the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he proved himself a friend!</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<small>DR. SEWARD&rsquo;S DIARY</small></h2>
    <p><em>30 September.</em>&mdash;I got home at five o&rsquo;clock, and found that Godalming and Morris had not only arrived,
    but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife had
    made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers&rsquo; men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had
    written to me. Mrs. Harker gave us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I have lived
    in it, this old house seemed like <em>home</em>. When we had finished, Mrs. Harker said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr. Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said
    of him in your diary interests me so much!&rdquo; She looked so appealing and so pretty that I could not refuse her, and
    there was no possible reason why I should; so I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a
    lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;let
    her come in, by all means; but just wait a minute till I tidy up the place.&rdquo; His method of tidying was peculiar: he
    simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he
    feared, or was jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting task, he said cheerfully: &ldquo;Let
    the lady come in,&rdquo; and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that he
    could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might have some homicidal intent; I remembered how
    quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I could seize him at
    once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once
    command the respect of any lunatic&mdash;for easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect. She walked
    over to him, smiling pleasantly, and held out her hand.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Renfield,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You see, I know you, for Dr. Seward has told me of you.&rdquo; He made no
    immediate reply, but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face.
    This look gave way to one of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can&rsquo;t be, you know, for she&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo; Mrs. Harker
    smiled sweetly as she replied:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs.
    Harker.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Then what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t stay.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But why not?&rdquo; I thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it
    was to me, so I joined in:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How did you know I wanted to marry any one?&rdquo; His reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pause in which he
    turned his eyes from Mrs. Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What an asinine question!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harker, at once championing me. He replied to her with as much
    courtesy and respect as he had shown contempt to me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so loved and honoured as our host is,
    everything regarding him is of interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his household and
    his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort
    causes and effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot but notice that the sophistic
    tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of <em>non causa</em> and <em>ignoratio elenchi</em>.&rdquo; I
    positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet lunatic&mdash;the most pronounced of his type
    that I had ever met with&mdash;talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished gentleman. I wonder
    if it was Mrs. Harker&rsquo;s presence which had touched some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or
    in any way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or power.</p>

    <p>We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at
    me questioningly as she began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for he addressed himself
    to the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned
    certain things.</p>
