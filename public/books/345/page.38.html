    <p>After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet until
    just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm
    which exhausted him so that he swooned into a sort of coma.</p>

    
    <p>... Three nights has the same thing happened&mdash;violent all day then quiet from moonrise to sunrise. I wish I
    could get some clue to the cause. It would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went. Happy
    thought! We shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. He escaped before without our help; to-night he shall
    escape with it. We shall give him a chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they are required....</p>

    
    <p><em>23 August.</em>&mdash;&ldquo;The unexpected always happens.&rdquo; How well Disraeli knew life. Our bird when he found the
    cage open would not fly, so all our subtle arrangements were for nought. At any rate, we have proved one thing; that
    the spells of quietness last a reasonable time. We shall in future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each
    day. I have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room, when once he is quiet, until
    an hour before sunrise. The poor soul&rsquo;s body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. Hark! The
    unexpected again! I am called; the patient has once more escaped.</p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;Another night adventure. Renfield artfully waited until the attendant was entering the room
    to inspect. Then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage. I sent word for the attendants to follow. Again
    he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him in the same place, pressed against the old chapel
    door. When he saw me he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he would have tried to kill
    me. As we were holding him a strange thing happened. He suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew
    calm. I looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. Then I caught the patient&rsquo;s eye and followed it, but
    could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlit sky except a big bat, which was flapping its silent and ghostly
    way to the west. Bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it
    was bound for or had some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and presently
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tie me; I shall go quietly!&rdquo; Without trouble we came back to the house. I feel there is something
    ominous in his calm, and shall not forget this night....</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Lucy Westenra&rsquo;s Diary</em></p>

    <p><em>Hillingham, 24 August.</em>&mdash;I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things down. Then we can have long
    talks when we do meet. I wonder when it will be. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I
    seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is the change of air, or getting home again. It is
    all dark and horrid to me, for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel so weak and worn out.
    When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me, and I hadn&rsquo;t the spirit to try to be cheerful. I
    wonder if I could sleep in mother&rsquo;s room to-night. I shall make an excuse and try.</p>

    
    <p><em>25 August.</em>&mdash;Another bad night. Mother did not seem to take to my proposal. She seems not too well
    herself, and doubtless she fears to worry me. I tried to keep awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the clock
    struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling asleep. There was a sort of scratching or
    flapping at the window, but I did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have fallen asleep.
    More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This morning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my
    throat pains me. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don&rsquo;t seem ever to get air enough. I shall try to
    cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I know he will be miserable to see me so.</p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;<em>Albemarle Hotel, 31 August.</em></p>

    <p class="nind">&ldquo;My dear Jack,&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no special disease, but she looks awful, and is
    getting worse every day. I have asked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for to disturb the
    poor lady&rsquo;s mind about her daughter in her present state of health would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me
    that her doom is spoken&mdash;disease of the heart&mdash;though poor Lucy does not know it yet. I am sure that there
    is something preying on my dear girl&rsquo;s mind. I am almost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a
    pang. I told her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at first&mdash;I know why, old
    fellow&mdash;she finally consented. It will be a painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for <em>her</em>
    sake, and I must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch
    at Hillingham to-morrow, two o&rsquo;clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will
    take an opportunity of being alone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; I am filled with
    anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as I can after you have seen her. Do not fail!</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Letter from Dr. Seward to Arthur Holmwood.</em></p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;<em>2 September.</em></p>

    <p class="nind">&ldquo;My dear old fellow,&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;With regard to Miss Westenra&rsquo;s health I hasten to let you know at once that in my opinion there is not any
    functional disturbance or any malady that I know of. At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with her
    appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I
    did not have full opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship makes a little difficulty
    which not even medical science or custom can bridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you
    to draw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have done and propose doing.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present, and in a few seconds I made up my mind
    that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no doubt she
    guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is. We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to
    be cheerful, we got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra
    went to lie down, and Lucy was left with me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,
    for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed, however, the mask fell from her face, and
    she sank down into a chair with a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. When I saw that her high spirits had
    failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis. She said to me very sweetly:&mdash;</p>
