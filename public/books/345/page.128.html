    <p>In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined him. He had found a wonderful spot, a
    sort of natural hollow in a rock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the hand and
    drew me in: &ldquo;See!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here you will be in shelter; and if the wolves do come I can<a name="page_349"
    id="page_349"></a> meet them one by one.&rdquo; He brought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some
    provisions and forced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was repulsive to me, and, much as I
    would have liked to please him, I could not bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not reproach
    me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top of the rock, and began to search the horizon.
    Suddenly he called out:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Look! Madam Mina, look! look!&rdquo; I sprang up and stood beside him on the rock; he handed me his glasses and
    pointed. The snow was now falling more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning to blow.
    However, there were times when there were pauses between the snow flurries and I could see a long way round. From
    the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the white waste of snow, I
    could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and
    not far off&mdash;in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before&mdash;came a group of mounted men
    hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog&rsquo;s
    tail wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the snow as they were, I could see from the
    men&rsquo;s clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind.</p>

    <p>On the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I felt that the end was coming. The
    evening was now drawing close, and well I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned there, would
    take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all pursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my
    consternation, however, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round the rock he had drawn a
    circle, such as we had found shelter in last night. When he had completed it he stood beside me again,
    saying:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;At least you shall be safe here from <em>him</em>!&rdquo; He took the glasses from me, and at the next lull of the snow
    swept the whole space below us. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and galloping as
    hard as they can.&rdquo; He paused and went on in a hollow voice:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God&rsquo;s will be done!&rdquo; Down came another blinding rush of
    driving snow, and the whole landscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his glasses were fixed
    on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the south. It must be Quincey and John. Take the
    glass. Look before the snow blots it all out!&rdquo; I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris.
    I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan. At the same time I <em>knew</em> that Jonathan was not far
    off; looking around I saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at break-neck speed. One of
    them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took, of course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party
    with the cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy, and, after looking intently till a
    snow fall made sight impossible, he laid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of
    our shelter. &ldquo;They are all converging,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When the time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.&rdquo; I got out
    my revolver ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer. When the snow
    storm abated a moment we looked again. It was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us, and
    beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all
    around us I could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbers&mdash;the wolves
    were gathering for their prey.</p>

    <p>Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with
    fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies. At times we could not see an arm&rsquo;s length before us; but at others, as
    the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We
    had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be;
    and we knew that before long the sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour
    that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now
    with fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly had driven the snow clouds from
    us, for, with only occasional bursts, the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the
    pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they
    were pursued; they seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the
    mountain tops.</p>

    <p>Closer and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind our
    rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined that they should not pass. One and all were
    quite unaware of our presence.</p>

    <p>All at once two voices shouted out to: &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; One was my Jonathan&rsquo;s, raised in a high key of passion; the other
    Mr. Morris&rsquo; strong resolute tone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but there was no
    mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were spoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord
    Godalming and Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the other. The leader of the gypsies,
    a splendid-looking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his
    companions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang forward; but the four men raised their
    Winchester rifles, and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van Helsing and I rose
    behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them. Seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and
    drew up. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he
    carried, knife or pistol, and held himself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.</p>
