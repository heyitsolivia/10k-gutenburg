    <p>When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy&rsquo;s strength. She was hardly able to turn
    her head, and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she slept, and both Van
    Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between sleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger,
    although more haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth,
    which thus looked positively longer and sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed
    the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying one. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we
    telegraphed for him. Quincey went off to meet him at the station.</p>

    <p>When he arrived it was nearly six o&rsquo;clock, and the sun was setting full and warm, and the red light streamed in
    through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking with emotion,
    and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed
    for it, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened. Arthur&rsquo;s
    presence, however, seemed to act as a stimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she had
    done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as cheerily as he could, so that the best was made
    of everything.</p>

    <p>It was now nearly one o&rsquo;clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with her. I am to relieve them in a quarter of
    an hour, and I am entering this on Lucy&rsquo;s phonograph. Until six o&rsquo;clock they are to try to rest. I fear that
    to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too great; the poor child cannot rally. God help us
    all.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra.</em>(Unopened by her.)</p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;<em>17 September.</em></p>

    <p class="nind">&ldquo;My dearest Lucy,&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It seems <em>an age</em> since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You will pardon me, I know, for all my
    faults when you have read all my budget of news. Well, I got my husband back
    all right; when we arrived at Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had an attack of
    gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined
    together. After dinner Mr. Hawkins said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;‘My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every blessing attend you both. I know you
    both from children, and have, with love and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here with me.
    I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in my will I have left you everything.&rsquo; I cried, Lucy
    dear, as Jonathan and the old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my bedroom and the drawing-room I can see
    the great elms of the cathedral close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the
    cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner
    of rooks&mdash;and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and housekeeping. Jonathan and Mr.
    Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that Jonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the
    clients.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a day or two to see you, dear, but I dare
    not go yet, with so much on my shoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to put some flesh
    on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep
    in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual placidity. However, thank God, these
    occasions grow less frequent as the days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now I have
    told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married, and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and
    what are you to wear, and is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it, dear; tell me all about
    everything, for there is nothing which interests you which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his
    ‘respectful duty,&rsquo; but I do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the important firm Hawkins
    &amp; Harker; and so, as you love me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb, I
    send you simply his ‘love&rsquo; instead. Good-bye, my dearest Lucy, and all blessings on you.</p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;Yours,&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mina Harker.</span>&rdquo;</p>
