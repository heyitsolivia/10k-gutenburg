    <p>As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we
    should ascertain his means of exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape. The proof of
    this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box <em>before
    sunrise</em>. There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess at; but there must have been
    some letter or message, since Skinsky came to Hildesheim.</p>

    <p>That, so far, his plans were successful we know. The <em>Czarina Catherine</em> made a phenomenally quick
    journey&mdash;so much so that Captain Donelson&rsquo;s suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his
    canniness played the Count&rsquo;s game for him, and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought
    up blindfold at Galatz. That the Count&rsquo;s arrangements were well made, has been proved. Hildesheim cleared the box,
    took it off, and gave it to Skinsky. Skinsky took it&mdash;and here we lose the trail. We only know that the box is
    somewhere on the water, moving along. The customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been avoided.</p>

    <p>Now we come to what the Count must have done after his arrival&mdash;<em>on land</em>, at Galatz.</p>

    <p>The box was given to Skinsky before sunrise. At sunrise the Count could appear in his own form. Here, we ask why
    Skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work? In my husband&rsquo;s diary, Skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the
    Slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man&rsquo;s remark, that the murder was the work of a Slovak, showed
    the general feeling against his class. The Count wanted isolation.</p>

    <p>My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his castle by water, as the most safe and
    secret way. He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took
    the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London. Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could
    arrange this service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his box, met
    Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and
    he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought, by murdering his agent.</p>

    <p>I have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the
    Pruth or the Sereth. I read in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my
    ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then, was on a river in an open boat&mdash;propelled probably
    either by oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There would be no such sound if
    floating down stream.</p>

    <p>Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may possibly investigate further. Now of these
    two, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up
    round the Borgo Pass. The loop it makes is manifestly as close to Dracula&rsquo;s castle as can be got by water.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Mina Harker&rsquo;s Journal&mdash;continued.</em></p>

    <p>When I had done reading, Jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me. The others kept shaking me by both hands,
    and Dr. Van Helsing said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Our dear Madam Mina is once more our teacher. Her eyes have been where we were blinded. Now we are on the track
    once again, and this time we may succeed. Our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on him by day, on
    the water, our task will be over. He has a start, but he is powerless to
    hasten, as he may not leave his box lest those who carry him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt
    them to throw him in the stream where he perish. This he knows, and will not. Now men, to our Council of War; for,
    here and now, we must plan what each and all shall do.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I shall get a steam launch and follow him,&rdquo; said Lord Godalming.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And I, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land,&rdquo; said Mr. Morris.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the Professor, &ldquo;both good. But neither must go alone. There must be force to overcome force if need
    be; the Slovak is strong and rough, and he carries rude arms.&rdquo; All the men smiled, for amongst them they carried a
    small arsenal. Said Mr. Morris:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have brought some Winchesters; they are pretty handy in a crowd, and there may be wolves. The Count, if you
    remember, took some other precautions; he made some requisitions on others that Mrs. Harker could not quite hear or
    understand. We must be ready at all points.&rdquo; Dr. Seward said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I think I had better go with Quincey. We have been accustomed to hunt together, and we two, well armed, will be
    a match for whatever may come along. You must not be alone, Art. It may be necessary to fight the Slovaks, and a
    chance thrust&mdash;for I don&rsquo;t suppose these fellows carry guns&mdash;would undo all our plans. There must be no
    chances, this time; we shall, not rest until the Count&rsquo;s head and body have been separated, and we are sure that he
    cannot re-incarnate.&rdquo; He looked at Jonathan as he spoke, and Jonathan looked at me. I could see that the poor dear
    was torn about in his mind. Of course he wanted to be with me; but then the boat service would, most likely, be the
    one which would destroy the ... the ... the ... Vampire. (Why did I hesitate to write the word?) He was silent
    awhile, and during his silence Dr. Van Helsing spoke:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Friend Jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. First, because you are young and brave and can fight, and all
    energies may be needed at the last; and again that it is your right to destroy him&mdash;that&mdash;which has
    wrought such woe to you and yours. Be not afraid for Madam Mina; she will be my care, if I may. I am old. My legs
    are not so quick to run as once; and I am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to fight with lethal
    weapons. But I can be of other service; I can fight in other way. And I can die, if need be, as well as younger men.
    Now let me say that what I would is this: while you, my Lord Godalming and
    friend Jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and whilst John and Quincey guard the bank where
    perchance he might be landed, I will take Madam Mina right into the heart of the enemy&rsquo;s country. Whilst the old fox
    is tied in his box, floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to land&mdash;where he dares not raise
    the lid of his coffin-box lest his Slovak carriers should in fear leave him to perish&mdash;we shall go in the track
    where Jonathan went,&mdash;from Bistritz over the Borgo, and find our way to the Castle of Dracula. Here, Madam
    Mina&rsquo;s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way&mdash;all dark and unknown otherwise&mdash;after
    the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place. There is much to be done, and other places to be made
    sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.&rdquo; Here Jonathan interrupted him hotly:&mdash;</p>
