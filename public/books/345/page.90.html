    <p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere, guv&rsquo;nor, there ain&rsquo;t no sense in me a-keepin&rsquo; you &rsquo;ere. I may find Sam soon, or I mayn&rsquo;t; but anyhow
    he ain&rsquo;t like to be in a way to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze. If you can
    give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on it, I&rsquo;ll find out where Sam is to be found and post it
    ye to-night. But ye&rsquo;d better be up arter &rsquo;im soon in the mornin&rsquo;, or maybe ye won&rsquo;t ketch &rsquo;im; for Sam gets off main
    early, never mind the booze the night afore.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and
    to keep the change. When she came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had again
    faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way to home. We&rsquo;re on the track anyhow. I am tired
    to-night, and want sleep. Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as though she had been
    crying. Poor dear, I&rsquo;ve no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me
    and the others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have
    her nerve broken. The doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business. I must be
    firm, for on me this particular burden of silence must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under
    any circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she herself has become reticent on the subject,
    and has not spoken of the Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.</p>

    
    <p><em>2 October, evening.</em>&mdash;A long and trying and exciting day. By the first post I got my directed envelope
    with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on which was written with a carpenter&rsquo;s pencil in a sprawling
    hand:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for the depite.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I
    determined not to wake her, but that, when I should return from this new
    search, I would arrange for her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home, with her daily
    tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told
    him where I was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should have found out anything. I
    drove to Walworth and found, with some difficulty, Potter&rsquo;s Court. Mr. Smollet&rsquo;s spelling misled me, as I asked for
    Poter&rsquo;s Court instead of Potter&rsquo;s Court. However, when I had found the court, I had no difficulty in discovering
    Corcoran&rsquo;s lodging-house. When I asked the man who came to the door for the &ldquo;depite,&rdquo; he shook his head, and said:
    &ldquo;I dunno &rsquo;im. There ain&rsquo;t no such a person &rsquo;ere; I never &rsquo;eard of &rsquo;im in all my bloomin&rsquo; days. Don&rsquo;t believe there
    ain&rsquo;t nobody of that kind livin&rsquo; ere or anywheres.&rdquo; I took out Smollet&rsquo;s letter, and as I read it it seemed to me
    that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me. &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the depity,&rdquo; he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right track; phonetic spelling had again misled
    me. A half-crown tip put the deputy&rsquo;s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who had slept off the
    remains of his beer on the previous night at Corcoran&rsquo;s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o&rsquo;clock that
    morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of
    a &ldquo;new-fangled ware&rsquo;us&rdquo;; and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve o&rsquo;clock before I got
    any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their
    dinner. One of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a new &ldquo;cold storage&rdquo; building; and
    as this suited the condition of a &ldquo;new-fangled ware&rsquo;us,&rdquo; I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly gatekeeper
    and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was
    sent for on my suggesting that I was willing to pay his day&rsquo;s wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a
    few questions on a private matter. He was a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had
    promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me that he had made two journeys between
    Carfax and a house in Piccadilly, and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes&mdash;&ldquo;main heavy
    ones&rdquo;&mdash;with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I asked him if
    he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to which he replied:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, guv&rsquo;nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a big white church or somethink of the
    kind, not long built. It was a dusty old &rsquo;ouse, too, though nothin&rsquo; to the dustiness of the &rsquo;ouse we tooked the
    bloomin&rsquo; boxes from.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin&rsquo; in the &rsquo;ouse at Purfleet. He &rsquo;elped me to lift the boxes and
    put them in the dray. Curse me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an&rsquo; him a old feller, with a white
    moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn&rsquo;t throw a shadder.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>How this phrase thrilled through me!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, &rsquo;e took up &rsquo;is end o&rsquo; the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and me a-puffin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-blowin&rsquo; afore I could
    up-end mine anyhow&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m no chicken, neither.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He was there too. He must &rsquo;a&rsquo; started off and got there afore me, for when I rung of the bell he kem an&rsquo; opened
    the door &rsquo;isself an&rsquo; &rsquo;elped me to carry the boxes into the &rsquo;all.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The whole nine?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yus; there was five in the first load an&rsquo; four in the second. It was main dry work, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t so well remember
    &rsquo;ow I got &rsquo;ome.&rdquo; I interrupted him:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Were the boxes left in the hall?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yus; it was a big &rsquo;all, an&rsquo; there was nothin&rsquo; else in it.&rdquo; I made one more attempt to further
    matters:&mdash;</p>
