    <p>&ldquo;And as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will. I want you to give me permission to read
    all Miss Lucy&rsquo;s papers and letters. Believe me, it is no idle curiosity. I have a motive of which, be sure, she
    would have approved. I have them all here. I took them before we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand
    might touch them&mdash;no strange eye look through words into her soul. I shall keep them, if I may; even you may
    not see them yet, but I shall keep them safe. No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back to
    you. It&rsquo;s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for Lucy&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Dr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I am doing what my dear one would have
    approved. I shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be all pain, nor will this pain be the last.
    We and you too&mdash;you most of all, my dear boy&mdash;will have to pass through the bitter water before we reach
    the sweet. But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our duty, and all will be well!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I slept on a sofa in Arthur&rsquo;s room that night. Van Helsing did not go to bed at all. He went to and fro, as if
    patrolling the house, and was never out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with the wild
    garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose, a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Mina Harker&rsquo;s Journal.</em></p>

    <p><em>22 September.</em>&mdash;In the train to Exeter. Jonathan sleeping.</p>

    <p>It seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much between then, in Whitby and all the world
    before me, Jonathan away and no news of him; and now, married to Jonathan, Jonathan a solicitor, a partner, rich,
    master of his business, Mr. Hawkins dead and buried, and Jonathan with another
    attack that may harm him. Some day he may ask me about it. Down it all goes. I am rusty in my shorthand&mdash;see
    what unexpected prosperity does for us&mdash;so it may be as well to freshen it up again with an exercise
    anyhow....</p>

    <p>The service was very simple and very solemn. There were only ourselves and the servants there, one or two old
    friends of his from Exeter, his London agent, and a gentleman representing Sir John Paxton, the President of the
    Incorporated Law Society. Jonathan and I stood hand in hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone
    from us....</p>

    <p>We came back to town quietly, taking a &rsquo;bus to Hyde Park Corner. Jonathan thought it would interest me to go into
    the Row for a while, so we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was sad-looking and desolate to
    see so many empty chairs. It made us think of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down Piccadilly.
    Jonathan was holding me by the arm, the way he used to in old days before I went to school. I felt it very improper,
    for you can&rsquo;t go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting
    into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn&rsquo;t know anybody who saw us&mdash;and we
    didn&rsquo;t care if they did&mdash;so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat,
    sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano&rsquo;s, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said
    under his breath: &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that some nervous fit may upset him
    again; so I turned to him quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.</p>

    <p>He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and half in amazement, he gazed at a tall,
    thin man, with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty girl. He was
    looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us, and so I had a good view of him. His face was not a good
    face; it was hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all the whiter because his lips were
    so red, were pointed like an animal&rsquo;s. Jonathan kept staring at him, till I was afraid he would notice. I feared he
    might take it ill, he looked so fierce and nasty. I asked Jonathan why he was disturbed, and he answered, evidently
    thinking that I knew as much about it as he did: &ldquo;Do you see who it is?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him; who is it?&rdquo; His answer seemed to shock and thrill me, for it was said as
    if he did not know that it was to me, Mina, to whom he was
    speaking:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It is the man himself!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The poor dear was evidently terrified at something&mdash;very greatly terrified; I do believe that if he had not
    had me to lean on and to support him he would have sunk down. He kept staring; a man came out of the shop with a
    small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove off. The dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the
    carriage moved up Piccadilly he followed in the same direction, and hailed a hansom. Jonathan kept looking after
    him, and said, as if to himself:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I believe it is the Count, but he has grown young. My God, if this be so! Oh, my God! my God! If I only knew! if
    I only knew!&rdquo; He was distressing himself so much that I feared to keep his mind on the subject by asking him any
    questions, so I remained silent. I drew him away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. We walked a little
    further, and then went in and sat for a while in the Green Park. It was a hot day for autumn, and there was a
    comfortable seat in a shady place. After a few minutes&rsquo; staring at nothing, Jonathan&rsquo;s eyes closed, and he went
    quietly into a sleep, with his head on my shoulder. I thought it was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him.
    In about twenty minutes he woke up, and said to me quite cheerfully:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, Mina, have I been asleep! Oh, do forgive me for being so rude. Come, and we&rsquo;ll have a cup of tea
    somewhere.&rdquo; He had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger, as in his illness he had forgotten all that this
    episode had reminded him of. I don&rsquo;t like this lapsing into forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to
    the brain. I must not ask him, for fear I shall do more harm than good; but I must somehow learn the facts of his
    journey abroad. The time is come, I fear, when I must open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you
    will, I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.</p>
