    <p>I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose which is generally indicative of some
    mental energy on his part. When I came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his
    lips:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What about souls?&rdquo; It was evident then that my surmise had been correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its
    work, even with the lunatic. I determined to have the matter out. &ldquo;What about
    them yourself?&rdquo; I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round him, and up and down, as though he
    expected to find some inspiration for an answer.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any souls!&rdquo; he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I
    determined to use it&mdash;to &ldquo;be cruel only to be kind.&rdquo; So I said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You like life, and you want life?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn&rsquo;t worry about that!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;how are we to get the life without getting the soul also?&rdquo; This seemed to puzzle him, so I
    followed it up:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A nice time you&rsquo;ll have some time when you&rsquo;re flying out there, with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders
    and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and miauing all round you. You&rsquo;ve got their lives, you know, and you must
    put up with their souls!&rdquo; Something seemed to affect his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut
    his eyes, screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped. There was something
    pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child&mdash;only a
    child, though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It was evident that he was undergoing
    some process of mental disturbance, and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to
    himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and go with him. The first step was to restore
    confidence, so I asked him, speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?&rdquo; He seemed to wake up all at once, and shook his head.
    With a laugh he replied:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Not much! flies are poor things, after all!&rdquo; After a pause he added, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want their souls buzzing round
    me, all the same.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Or spiders?&rdquo; I went on.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Blow spiders! What&rsquo;s the use of spiders? There isn&rsquo;t anything in them to eat or&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped suddenly, as
    though reminded of a forbidden topic.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;So, so!&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;this is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word ‘drink&rsquo;; what does it
    mean?&rdquo; Renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract my attention
    from it:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take any stock at all in such matters. ‘Rats and mice and such small deer,&rsquo; as Shakespeare has it,
    ‘chicken-feed of the larder&rsquo; they might be called. I&rsquo;m past all that sort of nonsense.<a name="page_253"
    id="page_253"></a> You might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to interest me
    about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You want big things that you can make your teeth meet in? How would you like to breakfast on
    elephant?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!&rdquo; He was getting too wide awake, so I thought I would press him hard.
    &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; I said reflectively, &ldquo;what an elephant&rsquo;s soul is like!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his high-horse and became a child again.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want an elephant&rsquo;s soul, or any soul at all!&rdquo; he said. For a few moments he sat despondently. Suddenly
    he jumped to his feet, with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. &ldquo;To hell with you and
    your souls!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Why do you plague me about souls? Haven&rsquo;t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me
    already, without thinking of souls!&rdquo; He looked so hostile that I thought he was in for another homicidal fit, so I
    blew my whistle. The instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so worried in my mind that I am apt to be
    irritable. If you only knew the problem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and tolerate, and
    pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I want to think and I cannot think freely when my body is
    confined. I am sure you will understand!&rdquo; He had evidently self-control; so when the attendants came I told them not
    to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield watched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable dignity
    and sweetness:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that I am very, very grateful to you!&rdquo; I
    thought it well to leave him in this mood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in this
    man&rsquo;s state. Several points seem to make what the American interviewer calls &ldquo;a story,&rdquo; if one could only get them
    in proper order. Here they are:&mdash;</p>

    <p>Will not mention &ldquo;drinking.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Fears the thought of being burdened with the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of anything.</p>

    <p>Has no dread of wanting &ldquo;life&rdquo; in the future.</p>

    <p>Despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being haunted by their souls.</p>

    <p>Logically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind that
    he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence&mdash;the burden of a soul. Then it is a human life he
    looks to!</p>

    <p>And the assurance&mdash;?</p>

    <p>Merciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of terror afoot!</p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my suspicion. He grew very grave; and,
    after thinking the matter over for a while asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door we
    heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago. When we entered we
    saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the autumn, were beginning
    to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not
    attend. He went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had got a scrap of paper and was
    folding it into a note-book. We had to come away as ignorant as we went in.</p>
