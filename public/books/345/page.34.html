    seems to be coming over our happiness. No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her
    mother&rsquo;s hours are numbering to a close. I do not understand Lucy&rsquo;s fading away as she is doing. She eats well and
    sleeps well, and enjoys the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and she gets weaker and
    more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping as if for air. I keep the key of our door always fastened to my
    wrist at night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open window. Last night I found her
    leaning out when I woke up, and when I tried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint. When I managed to restore
    her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long, painful struggles for breath. When I asked her how
    she came to be at the window she shook her head and turned away. I trust her feeling ill may not be from that
    unlucky prick of the safety-pin. I looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to
    have healed. They are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the
    edges of them are faintly white. They are like little white dots with red centres. Unless they heal within a day or
    two, I shall insist on the doctor seeing about them.</p>

    <p><em>18 August.</em>&mdash;I am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the churchyard. Lucy is ever so much
    better. Last night she slept well all night, and did not disturb me once. The roses seem coming back already to her
    cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. If she were in any way anæmic I could understand it, but she
    is not. She is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. All the morbid reticence seems to have passed from
    her, and she has just reminded me, as if I needed any reminding, of <em>that</em> night, and that it was here, on this
    very seat, I found her asleep. As she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My poor little feet didn&rsquo;t make much noise then! I daresay poor old Mr. Swales would have told me that it was
    because I didn&rsquo;t want to wake up Geordie.&rdquo; As she was in such a communicative humour, I asked her if she had dreamed
    at all that night. Before she answered, that sweet, puckered look came into her forehead, which Arthur&mdash;I call
    him Arthur from her habit&mdash;says he loves; and, indeed, I don&rsquo;t wonder that he does. Then she went on in a
    half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to herself:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. I only wanted to be here in this spot&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
    why, for I was afraid of something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what. I remember, though I suppose I was asleep, passing
    through the streets and over the bridge. A fish leaped as I went by, and I leaned over to look at it, and I heard a
    lot of dogs howling&mdash;the whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once&mdash;as I went up
    the steps. Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and
    something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once; and then I seemed sinking into deep green water, and
    there was a singing in my ears, as I have heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away
    from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air. I seem to remember that once the West Lighthouse was right under me, and then there was a sort of agonising feeling, as
    if I were in an earthquake, and I came back and found you shaking my body. I saw you do it before I felt you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Then she began to laugh. It seemed a little uncanny to me, and I listened to her breathlessly. I did not quite
    like it, and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other subjects, and Lucy was
    like her old self again. When we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more
    rosy. Her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent a very happy evening together.</p>
