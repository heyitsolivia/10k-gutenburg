    <p>&ldquo;And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad fact; tell me all that has been.&rdquo; I told
    him exactly what had happened, and he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched and his eyes
    blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with
    her mouth to the open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to see, that, whilst the face of
    white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair.
    Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door. They entered in obedience to our summons. Van
    Helsing looked at me questioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert
    if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding
    acquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming answered:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I looked in the study but, though he had
    been there, he had gone. He had, however&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on
    the bed. Van Helsing said gravely:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now is in knowing all. Tell freely!&rdquo; So Art
    went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few seconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the
    manuscript had been burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the cylinders of your
    phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax had helped the flames.&rdquo; Here I interrupted. &ldquo;Thank God there is
    the other copy in the safe!&rdquo; His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he went on: &ldquo;I ran downstairs then, but
    could see no sign of him. I looked into Renfield&rsquo;s room; but there was no trace there except&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; Again
    he paused. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue, added:
    &ldquo;except that the poor fellow is dead.&rdquo; Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of us she said
    solemnly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done!&rdquo; I could not but feel that Art was keeping back something; but, as I took it that it was
    with a purpose, I said nothing. Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It may be much eventually, but at present I can&rsquo;t say. I thought it well to know if
    possible where the Count would go when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from Renfield&rsquo;s
    window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some shape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other
    lair. He will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the dawn is close. We must work
    to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence,
    and I could fancy that I could hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his hand very
    tenderly on Mrs. Harker&rsquo;s head:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And now, Madam Mina&mdash;poor, dear, dear Madam Mina&mdash;tell us exactly what happened. God knows that I do
    not want that you be pained; but it is need that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done quick
    and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance
    that we may live and learn.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her
    and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held out one hand to
    Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and kissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was
    locked in that of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly. After a pause in which she was
    evidently ordering her thoughts, she began:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a long time it did not act. I seemed to
    become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind&mdash;all of them connected with
    death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.&rdquo; Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and
    said lovingly: &ldquo;Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me through the horrible task. If you only
    knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I need your
    help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work with my will, if it was to do me any good, so I
    resolutely set myself to sleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me,
    for I remember no more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when next I remember. There was
    in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find
    it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same
    sense of some presence. I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he
    who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I
    looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside the bed, as if he had stepped out of the
    mist&mdash;or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared&mdash;stood a tall,
    thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of the others. The waxen face; the high aquiline
    nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between;
    and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church at Whitby. I knew, too,
    the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant my heart stood still, and I would have
    screamed out, only that I was paralysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he
    spoke to Jonathan:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;‘Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out before your very eyes.&rsquo; I was
    appalled and was too bewildered to do or say anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder
    and, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did so, ‘First, a little refreshment to reward
    my exertions. You may as well be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have appeased my
    thirst!&rsquo; I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the
    horrible curse that such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity me! He placed his reeking
    lips upon my throat!&rdquo; Her husband groaned again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if he
    were the injured one, and went on:&mdash;</p>
