    <p>The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in front, and pointing first to the
    sun&mdash;now close down on the hill tops&mdash;and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.
    For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart. I should have
    felt terrible fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been upon me as well
    as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of
    our parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of
    undisciplined endeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order.</p>

    <p>In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring of men, and Quincey on the other, were
    forcing a way to the cart; it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set.
    Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies
    in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their attention. Jonathan&rsquo;s impetuosity,
    and the manifest singleness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they cowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the cart, and, with a
    strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime,
    Mr. Morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany. All the time I had been breathlessly
    watching Jonathan I had, with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had seen the knives of
    the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and they cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and
    at first I thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang beside Jonathan, who had by now jumped
    from the cart, I could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was spurting
    through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end
    of the chest, attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked the other frantically with his
    bowie. Under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and the
    top of the box was thrown back.</p>

    <p>By this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters, and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and
    Dr. Seward, had given in and made no resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the shadows of
    the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude
    falling from the cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared
    with the horrible vindictive look which I knew too well.</p>

    <p>As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them turned to triumph.</p>

    <p>But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan&rsquo;s great knife. I shrieked as I saw it shear through the
    throat; whilst at the same moment Mr. Morris&rsquo;s bowie knife plunged into the heart.</p>

    <p>It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumble
    into dust and passed from our sight.</p>

    <p>I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final dissolution, there was in the face a look of
    peace, such as I never could have imagined might have rested there.</p>

    <p>The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone of its broken battlements was
    articulated against the light of the setting sun.</p>

    <p>The gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary disappearance of the dead man, turned,
    without a word, and rode away as if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiter-wagon and
    shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their
    wake, leaving us alone.</p>

    <p>Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his hand pressed to his side; the blood
    still gushed through his fingers. I flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the two
    doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with
    a feeble effort, my hand in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of my heart in my
    face, for he smiled at me and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!&rdquo; he cried suddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture
    and pointing to me, &ldquo;It was worth for this to die! Look! look!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in
    rosy light. With one impulse the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; broke from all as their eyes
    followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man spoke:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not more stainless than her forehead! The
    curse has passed away!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a gallant gentleman.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">NOTE</h2>
    <p>Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of some of us since then is, we think, well
    worth the pain we endured. It is an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy&rsquo;s birthday is the same day as that on
    which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the secret belief that some of our brave friend&rsquo;s spirit has
    passed into him. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but we call him Quincey.</p>

    <p>In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went over the old ground which was, and is, to
    us so full of vivid and terrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things which we had seen
    with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were living truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out.
    The castle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.</p>

    <p>When we got home we were talking of the old time&mdash;which we could all look back on without despair, for
    Godalming and Seward are both happily married. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since our
    return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the mass of material of which the record is composed,
    there is hardly one authentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later note-books of Mina and
    Seward and myself, and Van Helsing&rsquo;s memorandum. We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these
    as proofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with our boy on his knee:&mdash;</p>
