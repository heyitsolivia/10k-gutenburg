    <p>When this was done, he lifted the child and said:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a funeral at noon, so here we shall all come
    before long after that. The friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock the gate we shall
    remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by
    to-morrow night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find him, as on the other night; and then
    to home.&rdquo; Coming close to Arthur, he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look back, you will see how it was necessary.
    You are now in the bitter waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will,
    please God, have passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn overmuch. Till then I shall not
    ask you to forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other on the way. We had left the child in
    safety, and were tired; so we all slept with more or less reality of sleep.</p>

    
    <p><em>29 September, night.</em>&mdash;A little before twelve o&rsquo;clock we three&mdash;Arthur, Quincey Morris, and
    myself&mdash;called for the Professor. It was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes.
    Of course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of us wore it by instinct. We got to the
    churchyard by half-past one, and strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the gravediggers
    had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the
    place all to ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a long leather one, something
    like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of fair weight.</p>

    <p>When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road, we silently, and as if by ordered
    intention, followed the Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it behind us. Then he
    took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting
    their own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work by. When he again lifted the lid
    off Lucy&rsquo;s coffin we all looked&mdash;Arthur trembling like an aspen&mdash;and saw that the body lay there in all
    its death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but loathing for the foul Thing which had taken
    Lucy&rsquo;s shape without her soul. I could see even Arthur&rsquo;s face grow hard as he looked. Presently he said to Van
    Helsing:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Is this really Lucy&rsquo;s body, or only a demon in her shape?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her as she was, and is.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous
    mouth&mdash;which it made one shudder to see&mdash;the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a
    devilish mockery of Lucy&rsquo;s sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual methodicalness, began taking the various
    contents from his bag and placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder,
    and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb,
    gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a
    round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long. One end of it was hardened
    by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in
    households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To me, a doctor&rsquo;s preparations for work of any kind
    are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of
    consternation. They both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet.</p>

    <p>When all was ready, Van Helsing said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all
    those who have studied the powers of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the curse of
    immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the
    world; for all that die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey on their kind. And so
    the circle goes on ever widening, like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had
    met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night when you open your arms to her, you would
    in time, when you had died, have become <em>nosferatu</em>, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would all time make
    more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror. The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun.
    Those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if she live on, Un-Dead, more and more
    they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that so wicked
    mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their
    plays unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true
    dead, then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by night and
    growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my
    friend, it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free. To this I am willing; but
    is there none amongst us who has a better right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night
    when sleep is not: â€˜It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it was the hand of him that loved her best; the
    hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?&rsquo;
    Tell me if there be such a one amongst us?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be
    the hand which would restore Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and said bravely,
    though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as snow:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me what I am to do, and I shall not
    falter!&rdquo; Van Helsing laid a hand on his shoulder, and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Brave lad! A moment&rsquo;s courage, and it is done. This stake must be driven through her. It will be a fearful
    ordeal&mdash;be not deceived in that&mdash;but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more than
    your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air. But you must not falter when
    once you have begun. Only think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for you all the
    time.&rdquo;</p>
