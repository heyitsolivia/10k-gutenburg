    <p>&ldquo;It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that&rsquo;s what it be, an&rsquo; nowt else. These bans an&rsquo; wafts an&rsquo;
    boh-ghosts an&rsquo; barguests an&rsquo; bogles an&rsquo; all anent them is only fit to set bairns an&rsquo; dizzy women a-belderin&rsquo;. They
    be nowt but air-blebs. They, an&rsquo; all grims an&rsquo; signs an&rsquo; warnin&rsquo;s, be all invented by parsons an&rsquo; illsome
    beuk-bodies an&rsquo; railway touters to skeer an&rsquo; scunner hafflin&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; to get folks to do somethin&rsquo; that they don&rsquo;t
    other incline to. It makes me ireful to think o&rsquo; them. Why, it&rsquo;s them that, not content with printin&rsquo; lies on paper
    an&rsquo; preachin&rsquo; them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin&rsquo; them on the tombstones. Look here all around you in what
    airt ye will; all them steans, holdin&rsquo; up their heads as well as they can out of their pride, is acant&mdash;simply
    tumblin&rsquo; down with the weight o&rsquo; the lies wrote on them, ‘Here lies the body&rsquo; or ‘Sacred to the memory&rsquo; wrote on all
    of them, an&rsquo; yet in nigh half of them there bean&rsquo;t no bodies at all; an&rsquo; the memories of them bean&rsquo;t cared a pinch
    of snuff about, much less sacred. Lies all of them, nothin&rsquo; but lies of one kind or another! My gog, but it&rsquo;ll be a
    quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they come tumblin&rsquo; up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an&rsquo;
    tryin&rsquo; to drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them trimmlin&rsquo; and ditherin&rsquo;, with
    their hands that dozzened an&rsquo; slippy from lyin&rsquo; in the sea that they can&rsquo;t even keep their grup o&rsquo; them.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I could see from the old fellow&rsquo;s self-satisfied air and the way in which he looked round for the approval of his
    cronies that he was &ldquo;showing off,&rdquo; so I put in a word to keep him
    going:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Swales, you can&rsquo;t be serious. Surely these tombstones are not all wrong?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin&rsquo; where they make out the people too good; for there be
    folk that do think a balm-bowl be like the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now look you
    here; you come here a stranger, an&rsquo; you see this kirk-garth.&rdquo; I nodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I
    did not quite understand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church. He went on: &ldquo;And you consate
    that all these steans be aboon folk that be happed here, snod an&rsquo; snog?&rdquo; I assented again. &ldquo;Then that be just where
    the lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as old Dun&rsquo;s &rsquo;bacca-box on Friday night.&rdquo; He
    nudged one of his companions, and they all laughed. &ldquo;And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at that one, the
    aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!&rdquo; I went over and read:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of Andres, April, 1854, æt. 30.&rdquo; When I
    came back Mr. Swales went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast of Andres! an&rsquo; you consated his body lay
    under! Why, I could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed
    northwards&mdash;&ldquo;or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the steans around ye. Ye can, with your
    young eyes, read the small-print of the lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey&mdash;I knew his father, lost in the
    <em>Lively</em> off Greenland in &rsquo;20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the same seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned
    off Cape Farewell a year later; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned in the Gulf of
    Finland in &rsquo;50. Do ye think that all these men will have to make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me
    antherums aboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they&rsquo;d be jommlin&rsquo; an&rsquo; jostlin&rsquo; one another that way that it
    &rsquo;ud be like a fight up on the ice in the old days, when we&rsquo;d be at one another from daylight to dark, an&rsquo; tryin&rsquo; to
    tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.&rdquo; This was evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled
    over it, and his cronies joined in with gusto.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the assumption that all the poor people, or
    their spirits, will have to take their tombstones with them on the Day of
    Judgment. Do you think that will be really necessary?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To please their relatives, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To please their relatives, you suppose!&rdquo; This he said with intense scorn. &ldquo;How will it pleasure their relatives
    to know that lies is wrote over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?&rdquo; He pointed to a
    stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff.
    &ldquo;Read the lies on that thruff-stean,&rdquo; he said. The letters were upside down to me from where I sat, but Lucy was
    more opposite to them, so she leant over and read:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a glorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873,
    falling from the rocks at Kettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly beloved son. ‘He
    was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.&rsquo; Really, Mr. Swales, I don&rsquo;t see anything very funny in that!&rdquo;
    She spoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that&rsquo;s because ye don&rsquo;t gawm the sorrowin&rsquo; mother was a hell-cat that
    hated him because he was acrewk&rsquo;d&mdash;a regular lamiter he was&mdash;an&rsquo; he hated her so that he committed suicide
    in order that she mightn&rsquo;t get an insurance she put on his life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old
    musket that they had for scarin&rsquo; the crows with. &rsquo;Twarn&rsquo;t for crows then, for it brought the clegs and the dowps to
    him. That&rsquo;s the way he fell off the rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I&rsquo;ve often heard him say
    masel&rsquo; that he hoped he&rsquo;d go to hell, for his mother was so pious that she&rsquo;d be sure to go to heaven, an&rsquo; he didn&rsquo;t
    want to addle where she was. Now isn&rsquo;t that stean at any rate&rdquo;&mdash;he hammered it with his stick as he
    spoke&mdash;&ldquo;a pack of lies? and won&rsquo;t it make Gabriel keckle when Geordie comes pantin&rsquo; up the grees with the
    tombstean balanced on his hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!&rdquo;</p>
