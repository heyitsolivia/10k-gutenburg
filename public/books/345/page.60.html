    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;A sad home-coming in every way&mdash;the house empty of the dear soul who was so good to us;
    Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he
    may be:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and that Lucy died the day before yesterday.
    They were both buried to-day.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Oh, what a wealth of sorrow in a few words! Poor Mrs. Westenra! poor Lucy! Gone, gone, never to return to us! And
    poor, poor Arthur, to have lost such sweetness out of his life! God help us all
    to bear our troubles.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>22 September.</em>&mdash;It is all over. Arthur has gone back to Ring, and has taken Quincey Morris with him.
    What a fine fellow is Quincey! I believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about Lucy&rsquo;s death as any of
    us; but he bore himself through it like a moral Viking. If America can go on breeding men like that, she will be a
    power in the world indeed. Van Helsing is lying down, having a rest preparatory to his journey. He goes over to
    Amsterdam to-night, but says he returns to-morrow night; that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only
    be made personally. He is to stop with me then, if he can; he says he has work to do in London which may take him
    some time. Poor old fellow! I fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength. All the
    time of the burial he was, I could see, putting some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were
    standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been
    transfused to his Lucy&rsquo;s veins; I could see Van Helsing&rsquo;s face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was saying
    that he felt since then as if they two had been really married and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None
    of us said a word of the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went away together to the
    station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit
    of hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted that it was only his sense of humour
    asserting itself under very terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down the blinds lest
    any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried, till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just
    as a woman does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the circumstances; but it had no effect.
    Men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew grave and
    stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time. His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it
    was logical and forceful and mysterious. He said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad, though I laugh. See, I have cried even
    when the laugh did choke me. But no more think that I am all sorry when I cry,
    for the laugh he come just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say, ‘May I
    come in?&rsquo; is not the true laughter. No! he is a king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose
    no time of suitability. He say, ‘I am here.&rsquo; Behold, in example I grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl;
    I give my blood for her, though I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other sufferers want
    that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very grave&mdash;laugh when the clay from the spade of the
    sexton drop upon her coffin and say ‘Thud! thud!&rsquo; to my heart, till it send back the blood from my cheek. My heart
    bleed for that poor boy&mdash;that dear boy, so of the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and
    with his hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet when he say things that touch my
    husband-heart to the quick, and make my father-heart yearn to him as to no other man&mdash;not even to you, friend
    John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son&mdash;yet even at such moment King Laugh he come to
    me and shout and bellow in my ear, ‘Here I am! here I am!&rsquo; till the blood come dance back and bring some of the
    sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is a strange world, a sad world, a world full of
    miseries, and woes, and troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the tune he play. Bleeding
    hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and tears that burn as they fall&mdash;all dance together to the music that
    he make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men
    and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and, like the rain on
    the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like
    the sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with our labour, what it may be.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I did not yet understand the cause of his
    laughter, I asked him. As he answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different tone:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, it was the grim irony of it all&mdash;this so lovely lady garlanded with flowers, that looked so fair as
    life, till one by one we wondered if she were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely
    churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother who loved her, and whom she loved; and that
    sacred bell going ‘Toll! toll! toll!&rsquo; so sad and slow; and those holy men, with
    the white garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time their eyes never on the page; and
    all of us with the bowed head. And all for what? She is dead; so! Is it not?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, for the life of me, Professor,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anything to laugh at in all that. Why, your
    explanation makes it a harder puzzle than before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor Art and
    his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had made her truly his bride?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so
    sweet maid is a polyandrist, and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church&rsquo;s law, though no wits, all
    gone&mdash;even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife, am bigamist.&rdquo;</p>
