    
    <p><em>Same day, later.</em>&mdash;I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have come safely back to this room. I
    must put down every detail in order. I went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side,
    and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side. The stones are big
    and roughly cut, and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I took off my boots, and
    ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth
    would not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty well the direction and distance of
    the Count&rsquo;s window, and made for it as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did not feel
    dizzy&mdash;I suppose I was too excited&mdash;and the time seemed ridiculously short till I found myself standing on
    the window-sill and trying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when I bent down and slid
    feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a
    discovery. The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which seemed to have never been used; the
    furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked for the key,
    but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one
    corner&mdash;gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money,
    covered with a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments, some
    jewelled, but all of them old and stained.</p>

    <p>At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I could not find the key of the room or the
    key of the outer door, which was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or all my efforts
    would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I
    descended, minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit by loopholes in the heavy
    masonry. At the bottom there was a dark, tunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the odour
    of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a
    heavy door which stood ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently been used as a
    graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug
    over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been brought by the Slovaks. There was
    nobody about, and I made search for any further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of the
    ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do
    so was a dread to my very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles
    of dust; in the third, however, I made a discovery.</p>

    <p>There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count!
    He was either dead or asleep, I could not say which&mdash;for the eyes were open and stony, but without the
    glassiness of death&mdash;and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor; the lips were as red as
    ever. But there was no sign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him, and tried to
    find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away
    in a few hours. By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there. I thought he might have the
    keys on him, but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,
    though unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and leaving the Count&rsquo;s room by the window,
    crawled again up the castle wall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think....</p>

    
    <p><em>29 June.</em>&mdash;To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has taken steps to prove that it was
    genuine, for again I saw him leave the castle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,
    lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might destroy him; but I fear that no weapon
    wrought alone by man&rsquo;s hand would have any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared to see
    those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there till I fell asleep.</p>

    <p>I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can look as he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful England, I to some work which may have such an
    end that we may never meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be here, but all shall be
    ready for your journey. In the morning come the Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some
    Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the
    diligence from Bukovina to Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle Dracula.&rdquo; I suspected
    him, and determined to test his sincerity. Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in
    connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why may I not go to-night?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.&rdquo; He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile
    that I knew there was some trick behind his smoothness. He said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And your baggage?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes, it seemed so real:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is that which rules our <em>boyars</em>:
    ‘Welcome the coming; speed the parting guest.&rsquo; Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait in my
    house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that you so suddenly desire it. Come!&rdquo; With a stately
    gravity, he, with the lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he stopped.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand,
    just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the
    conductor. After a pause of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back the ponderous bolts,
    unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it open.</p>
