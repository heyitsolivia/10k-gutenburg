    <p>&ldquo;Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter Hawkins, or to any other?&rdquo; It was with some
    bitterness in my heart that I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of sending letters
    to anybody.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Then write now, my young friend,&rdquo; he said, laying a heavy hand on my shoulder: &ldquo;write to our friend and to any
    other; and say, if it will please you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Do you wish me to stay so long?&rdquo; I asked, for my heart grew cold at the thought.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master, employer, what you will, engaged that someone
    should come on his behalf, it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not stinted. Is it not
    so?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins&rsquo;s interest, not mine, and I had to think of him, not
    myself; and besides, while Count Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me
    remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow,
    and his mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but in his own smooth, resistless
    way:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters. It
    will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting home to them. Is
    it not so?&rdquo; As he spoke he handed me three sheets of note-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest
    foreign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood as well as if he had spoken that
    I should be careful what I wrote, for he would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes now,
    but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for to her I could write in shorthand, which would
    puzzle the Count, if he did see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a book whilst the Count
    wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to some books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them
    with his own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door had closed behind him, I leaned
    over and looked at the letters, which were face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for under the
    circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way I could.</p>

    <p>One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner,
    Varna; the third was to Coutts &amp; Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock &amp; Billreuth, bankers,
    Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just about to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I
    sank back in my seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and to resume my book before the
    Count, holding still another letter in his hand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped
    them carefully, and then turning to me, said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this evening. You will, I hope, find all
    things as you wish.&rdquo; At the door he turned, and after a moment&rsquo;s pause said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Let me advise you, my dear young friend&mdash;nay, let me warn you with all seriousness, that should you leave
    these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has many
    memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be warned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you,
    or be like to do, then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be safe. But if you be
    not careful in this respect, then&rdquo;&mdash;He finished his speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as
    if he were washing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more terrible than
    the unnatural, horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me.</p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no doubt in question. I shall not
    fear to sleep in any place where he is not. I have placed the crucifix over the
    head of my bed&mdash;I imagine that my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.</p>

    <p>When he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone
    stair to where I could look out towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse, inaccessible
    though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was
    indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of the night. I am beginning to feel
    this nocturnal existence tell on me. It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all sorts
    of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out
    over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day. In the soft light
    the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty
    seemed to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I leaned from the window my eye was
    caught by something moving a storey below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of the
    rooms, that the windows of the Count&rsquo;s own room would look out. The window at which I stood was tall and deep,
    stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since the case had been
    there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out.</p>

    <p>What I saw was the Count&rsquo;s head coming out from the window. I did not see the face, but I knew the man by the
    neck and the movement of his back and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had so many
    opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter
    will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when I saw
    the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,
    <em>face down</em> with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At first I could not believe my eyes. I
    thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could be no
    delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of
    years, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed, just as a lizard
    moves along a wall.</p>
