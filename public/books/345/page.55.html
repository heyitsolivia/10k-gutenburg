    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>20 September.</em>&mdash;Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry to-night. I am too miserable, too
    low-spirited, too sick of the world and all in it, including life itself, that I would not care if I heard this
    moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. And he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of
    late&mdash;Lucy&rsquo;s mother and Arthur&rsquo;s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.</p>

    <p>I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy. We wanted Arthur to go to rest also, but he refused at first.
    It was only when I told him that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down
    for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go. Van Helsing was very kind to him. &ldquo;Come, my child,&rdquo;
    he said; &ldquo;come with me. You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much mental pain, as well as that tax on
    your strength that we know of. You must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms. Come to the
    drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two sofas. You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our
    sympathy will be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we sleep.&rdquo; Arthur went off with
    him, casting back a longing look on Lucy&rsquo;s face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. She lay quite
    still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as it should be. I could see that the Professor had carried
    out in this room, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the window-sashes reeked with it,
    and round Lucy&rsquo;s neck, over the silk handkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of the
    same odorous flowers. Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and her face was at its worst, for the open mouth
    showed the pale gums. Her teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the
    morning. In particular, by some trick of the light, the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. I sat
    down by her, and presently she moved uneasily. At the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at
    the window. I went over to it softly, and peeped out by the corner of the blind. There was a full moonlight, and I
    could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled round&mdash;doubtless attracted by the light,
    although so dim&mdash;and every now and again struck the window with its wings. When I came back to my seat, I found
    that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic flowers from her
    throat. I replaced them as well as I could, and sat watching her.</p>

    <p>Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed. She took but a little, and that
    languidly. There did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so
    marked her illness. It struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers
    close to her. It was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the stertorous breathing,
    she put the flowers from her; but that when she waked she clutched them close. There was no possibility of making
    any mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated
    both actions many times.</p>

    <p>At six o&rsquo;clock Van Helsing came to relieve me. Arthur had then fallen into a doze, and he mercifully let him
    sleep on. When he saw Lucy&rsquo;s face I could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a sharp
    whisper: &ldquo;Draw up the blind; I want light!&rdquo; Then he bent down, and, with his face almost touching Lucy&rsquo;s, examined
    her carefully. He removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. As he did so he started
    back, and I could hear his ejaculation, &ldquo;Mein Gott!&rdquo; as it was smothered in his throat. I bent over and looked, too,
    and as I noticed some queer chill came over me.</p>

    <p>The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.</p>

    <p>For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face at its sternest. Then he turned to me and
    said calmly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;She is dying. It will not be long now. It will be much difference, mark me, whether she dies conscious or in her
    sleep. Wake that poor boy, and let him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I went to the dining-room and waked him. He was dazed for a moment, but when he saw the sunlight streaming in
    through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late, and expressed his fear. I assured him that Lucy was still
    asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van Helsing and I feared that the end was near. He covered his
    face with his hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained, perhaps a minute, with his head
    buried, praying, whilst his shoulders shook with grief. I took him by the hand and raised him up. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I said,
    &ldquo;my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best and easiest for her.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When we came into Lucy&rsquo;s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with his
    usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible. He had even
    brushed Lucy&rsquo;s hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. When we came into the room she opened
    her eyes, and seeing him, whispered softly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!&rdquo; He was stooping to kiss her, when Van Helsing motioned him
    back. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;not yet! Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best, with all the soft lines matching the
    angelic beauty of her eyes. Then gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. For a little bit her breast
    heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child&rsquo;s.</p>

    <p>And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in the night. Her breathing grew
    stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. In a
    sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in
    a soft, voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from her lips:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!&rdquo; Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her; but at that
    instant Van Helsing, who, like me, had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by the neck
    with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which I never thought he could have possessed, and
    actually hurled him almost across the room.</p>
