    <p>Her, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the Vampire in that Holy circle; and yet even
    there would be the wolf! I resolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must submit, if it were
    God&rsquo;s will. At any rate it was only death and freedom beyond. So did I choose
    for her. Had it but been for myself the choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the
    grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.</p>

    <p>I knew that there were at least three graves to find&mdash;graves that are inhabit; so I search, and search, and
    I find one of them. She lay in her Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as though I
    have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when such things were, many a man who set forth to do such
    a task as mine, found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay, and delay, and delay, till
    the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset
    come, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love, and the
    voluptuous mouth present to a kiss&mdash;and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire fold; one
    more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...</p>

    <p>There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence of such an one, even lying as she lay in
    a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of
    the Count have had. Yes, I was moved&mdash;I, Van Helsing, with all my purpose and with my motive for hate&mdash;I
    was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my very soul. It may have been
    that the need of natural sleep, and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it was
    that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination, when there came through
    the snow-stilled air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion. For it
    was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.</p>

    <p>Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the
    other dark one. I dared not pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should begin to be
    enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that
    other fair sister which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of the mist. She was so fair to
    look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of
    my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail
    of my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could
    be wrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had searched all the tombs in the
    chapel, so far as I could tell; and as there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the night, I
    took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent. There was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest;
    huge it was, and nobly proportioned. On it was but one word</p>

    <p class="letra">DRACULA.</p>

    <p>This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more were due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent
    to make certain what I knew. Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my awful work, I
    laid in Dracula&rsquo;s tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished him from it, Un-Dead, for ever.</p>

    <p>Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it had been easy, comparative. But three! To
    begin twice more after I had been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet Miss Lucy, what
    would it not be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the
    passing of the years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....</p>

    <p>Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by thoughts of other dead, and of the living
    over whom hung such a pall of fear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though till all was
    over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole
    over it just ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been won, I could not have gone
    further with my butchery. I could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of
    writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and left my work undone. But it is over! And
    the poor souls, I can pity them now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death for a short
    moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife severed the head of each, before the whole body began to
    melt away and crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come centuries agone had at last
    assert himself and say at once and loud &ldquo;I am here!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Before I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can the Count enter there Un-Dead.</p>

    <p>When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in
    pain that I had endured too much.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my husband who is, I know, coming towards
    us.&rdquo; She was looking thin and pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was glad to see her
    paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.</p>

    <p>And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet our friends&mdash;and
    <em>him</em>&mdash;whom Madam Mina tell me that she <em>know</em> are coming to meet us.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Mina Harker&rsquo;s Journal.</em></p>

    <p><em>6 November.</em>&mdash;It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I took our way towards the east
    whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take heavy
    rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We
    had to take some of our provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we could see through
    the snowfall, there was not even the sign of habitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy
    walking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the clear line of Dracula&rsquo;s castle cut the sky; for
    we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the Carpathian mountains was far
    below it. We saw it in all its grandeur, perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with
    seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side. There was something wild and
    uncanny about the place. We could hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the sound, even though
    coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was full of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching
    about that he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less exposed in case of attack. The rough
    roadway still led downwards; we could trace it through the drifted snow.</p>
