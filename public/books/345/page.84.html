    <p>I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the conviction, despite my knowledge of the man&rsquo;s
    character and history, that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to tell him that I was
    satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought
    it better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old I knew the sudden changes to which this
    particular patient was liable. So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be
    improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him in the morning, and would then see what I could do
    in the direction of meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said quickly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to go
    at once&mdash;here&mdash;now&mdash;this very hour&mdash;this very moment, if I may. Time presses, and in our implied
    agreement with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put before
    so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.&rdquo; He looked
    at me keenly, and seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised them closely. Not meeting
    any sufficient response, he went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You have,&rdquo; I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally. There was a considerable pause, and then
    he said slowly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for this concession&mdash;boon, privilege,
    what you will. I am content to implore in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I am not
    at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I assure you, take it from me that they are good ones,
    sound and unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look, sir, into my heart, you would
    approve to the full the sentiments which animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of
    your friends.&rdquo; Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire
    intellectual method was but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let him go on a little
    longer, knowing from experience that he would, like all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was
    gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his
    look. He said to Renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it
    afterwards&mdash;for it was as of one addressing an equal:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free to-night? I will undertake that if you will
    satisfy even me&mdash;a stranger, without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind&mdash;Dr. Seward
    will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the privilege you seek.&rdquo; He shook his head sadly, and
    with a look of poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree, since you seek to impress
    us with your complete reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since you are not yet
    released from medical treatment for this very defect. If you will not help us in our effort<a name="page_229"
    id="page_229"></a> to choose the wisest course, how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise,
    and help us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.&rdquo; He still shook his head as he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and if I were free to speak I should not
    hesitate a moment; but I am not my own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am refused, the
    responsibility does not rest with me.&rdquo; I thought it was now time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically
    grave, so I went towards the door, simply saying:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He moved towards me so quickly that for the
    moment I feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were groundless, for he held
    up his two hands imploringly, and made his petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his
    emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old relations, he became still more demonstrative. I
    glanced at Van Helsing, and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more fixed in my manner,
    if not more stern, and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same
    constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much,
    such, for instance, as when he wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen
    acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised, for, when he found that his appeal would not be
    successful, he got into quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up his hands, wringing
    them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and
    his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out of this house at once. Send me away how
    you will and where you will; send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a strait-waistcoat,
    manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go out of this. You don&rsquo;t know what you do by keeping me here. I
    am speaking from the depths of my heart&mdash;of my very soul. You don&rsquo;t know whom you wrong, or how; and I may not
    tell. Woe is me! I may not tell. By all you hold sacred&mdash;by all you hold dear&mdash;by your love that is lost&mdash;by your hope that lives&mdash;for the sake of the Almighty, take me
    out of this and save my soul from guilt! Can&rsquo;t you hear me, man? Can&rsquo;t you understand? Will you never learn? Don&rsquo;t
    you know that I am sane and earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting for his soul?
    Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so would bring on a fit; so I took him by the
    hand and raised him up.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I said sternly, &ldquo;no more of this; we have had quite enough already. Get to your bed and try to behave
    more discreetly.&rdquo;</p>
