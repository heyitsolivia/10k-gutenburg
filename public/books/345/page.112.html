    <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Van Helsing, &ldquo;Winchesters it shall be. Quincey&rsquo;s head is level at all times, but most so when there
    is to hunt, metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. In the meantime we can do nothing
    here; and as I think that Varna is not familiar to any of us, why not go there more soon? It is as long to wait here
    as there. To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we four can set out on our
    journey.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We four?&rdquo; said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of us.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; answered the Professor quickly, &ldquo;you must remain to take care of your so sweet wife!&rdquo; Harker was
    silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Let us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with Mina.&rdquo; I thought that now was the time for
    Van Helsing to warn him not to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him significantly and
    coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and turned away.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Jonathan Harker&rsquo;s Journal.</em></p>

    <p><em>5 October, afternoon.</em>&mdash;For some time after our meeting this morning I could not think. The new phases
    of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina&rsquo;s determination not to
    take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could not argue the matter with her, I could only guess. I
    am as far as ever from a solution now. The way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the last time we talked of
    the subject we agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly
    and sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams with happiness. Thank God, there are such
    moments still for her.</p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina&rsquo;s happy sleep, and came as near to being happy
    myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking
    lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me
    tenderly, said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Jonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour. A promise made to me, but made holily in
    God&rsquo;s hearing, and not to be broken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter tears. Quick,
    you must make it to me at once.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Mina,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;a promise like that, I cannot make at once. I may have no right to make it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But, dear one,&rdquo; she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes were like pole stars, &ldquo;it is I who wish
    it; and it is not for myself. You can ask Dr. Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may do as you will.
    Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved from the promise.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I promise!&rdquo; I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though to me all happiness for her was denied
    by the red scar on her forehead. She said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for the campaign against the Count. Not by
    word, or inference, or implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!&rdquo; and she solemnly pointed to the
    scar. I saw that she was in earnest, and said solemnly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I promise!&rdquo; and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had been shut between us.</p>

    
    <p><em>Later, midnight.</em>&mdash;Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening. So much so that all the rest
    seemed to take courage, as if infected somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall of
    gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it
    is a wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible trouble. Thank God for
    it, for then at least she can forget her care. Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall
    try it. Oh! for a dreamless sleep.</p>

    
    <p><em>6 October, morning.</em>&mdash;Another surprise. Mina woke me early, about the same time as yesterday, and
    asked me to bring Dr. Van Helsing. I thought that it was another occasion for hypnotism,<a name="page_305"
    id="page_305"></a> and without question went for the Professor. He had evidently expected some such call, for I
    found him dressed in his room. His door was ajar, so that he could hear the opening of the door of our room. He came
    at once; as he passed into the room, he asked Mina if the others might come, too.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said quite simply, &ldquo;it will not be necessary. You can tell them just as well. I must go with you on
    your journey.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Dr. Van Helsing was as startled as I was. After a moment&rsquo;s pause he asked:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You must take me with you. I am safer with you, and you shall be safer, too.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But why, dear Madam Mina? You know that your safety is our solemnest duty. We go into danger, to which you are,
    or may be, more liable than any of us from&mdash;from circumstances&mdash;things that have been.&rdquo; He paused,
    embarrassed.</p>

    <p>As she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I know. That is why I must go. I can tell you now, whilst the sun is coming up; I may not be able again. I know
    that when the Count wills me I must go. I know that if he tells me to come in secret, I must come by wile; by any
    device to hoodwink&mdash;even Jonathan.&rdquo; God saw the look that she turned on me as she spoke, and if there be indeed
    a Recording Angel that look is noted to her everlasting honour. I could only clasp her hand. I could not speak; my
    emotion was too great for even the relief of tears. She went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You men are brave and strong. You are strong in your numbers, for you can defy that which would break down the
    human endurance of one who had to guard alone. Besides, I may be of service, since you can hypnotise me and so learn
    that which even I myself do not know.&rdquo; Dr. Van Helsing said very gravely:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Madam Mina, you are, as always, most wise. You shall with us come; and together we shall do that which we go
    forth to achieve.&rdquo; When he had spoken, Mina&rsquo;s long spell of silence made me look at her. She had fallen back on her
    pillow asleep; she did not even wake when I had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room.
    Van Helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly. We went to his room, and within a minute Lord Godalming, Dr.
    Seward, and Mr. Morris were with us also. He told them what Mina had said, and went on:&mdash;</p>
