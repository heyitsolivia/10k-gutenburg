    
    <p><em>20 July.</em>&mdash;Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his rounds. Found him up and humming
    a tune. He was spreading out his sugar, which he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his
    fly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I looked around for his birds, and not seeing
    them, asked him where they were. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away. There were a few
    feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to
    me if there were anything odd about him during the day.</p>

    
    <p><em>11 a. m.</em>&mdash;The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has been very sick and has disgorged
    a whole lot of feathers. &ldquo;My belief is, doctor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took and
    ate them raw!&rdquo;</p>

    
    <p><em>11 p. m.</em>&mdash;I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make even him sleep, and took away his
    pocket-book to look at it. The thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory
    proved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to invent a new classification<a name="page_067"
    id="page_067"></a> for him, and call him a zoöphagous (life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many
    lives as he can, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He gave many flies to one spider and
    many spiders to one bird, and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later steps? It
    would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It might be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men
    sneered at vivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science in its most difficult and vital
    aspect&mdash;the knowledge of the brain? Had I even the secret of one such mind&mdash;did I hold the key to the
    fancy of even one lunatic&mdash;I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch compared with which
    Burdon-Sanderson&rsquo;s physiology or Ferrier&rsquo;s brain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient
    cause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good cause might turn the scale with me, for may
    not I too be of an exceptional brain, congenitally?</p>

    <p>How well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I wonder at how many lives he values a man,
    or if at only one. He has closed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How many of us begin a
    new record with each day of our lives?</p>

    <p>To me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope, and that truly I began a new record. So
    it will be until the Great Recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to profit or loss. Oh,
    Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only
    wait on hopeless and work. Work! work!</p>

    <p>If I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there&mdash;a good, unselfish cause to make me
    work&mdash;that would be indeed happiness.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Mina Murray&rsquo;s Journal.</em></p>

    <p><em>26 July.</em>&mdash;I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it is like whispering to one&rsquo;s self
    and listening at the same time. And there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from
    writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very
    concerned; but yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from him. I had written asking
    him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed had just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,
    and says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan; I do not
    understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy, although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit
    of walking in her sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided that I am to lock the door of our
    room every night. Mrs. Westenra has got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and along the
    edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place.
    Poor dear, she is naturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy&rsquo;s father, had the same
    habit; that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married
    in the autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged. I sympathise with
    her, for I do the same, only Jonathan and I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to make
    both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood&mdash;he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only son of Lord Godalming&mdash;is coming up
    here very shortly&mdash;as soon as he can leave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is
    counting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him the
    beauty of Whitby. I daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he arrives.</p>

    
    <p><em>27 July.</em>&mdash;No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him, though why I should I do not
    know; but I do wish that he would write, if it were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I
    am awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold; but still the
    anxiety and the perpetually being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and wakeful myself.
    Thank God, Lucy&rsquo;s health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been
    taken seriously ill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch her looks; she is a trifle
    stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely rose-pink. She has lost that anæmic look which she had. I pray it will all
    last.</p>

    
    <p><em>3 August.</em>&mdash;Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have
    heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He surely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but somehow it
    does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is his writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not
    walked much in her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about
    her which I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching me. She tries the door, and finding it
    locked, goes about the room searching for the key.</p>
