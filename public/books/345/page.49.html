    <p>He took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the
    elementary conditions of the fatted calf, and went off to report.</p>

    <p>I came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given to-day regarding the strange escapade at
    the Zoo.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>17 September.</em>&mdash;I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my books, which, through press of
    other work and the many visits to Lucy, had fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in
    rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was thunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting
    of his own accord into the Superintendent&rsquo;s study is almost unknown. Without an instant&rsquo;s pause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and, as I saw he was
    dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was too quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could
    get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely. Before he could strike again, however, I
    got in my right and he was sprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a little pool
    trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my
    wrist, keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the attendants rushed in, and we turned our
    attention to him, his employment positively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking up, like a
    dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the
    attendants quite placidly, simply repeating over and over again: &ldquo;The blood is the life! The blood is the
    life!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of late for my physical good, and then the
    prolonged strain of Lucy&rsquo;s illness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and weary, and I need
    rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned me, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well
    do without it.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Telegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax.</em></p>

    <p class="letra">(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late by twenty-two hours.)</p>

    <p>&ldquo;<em>17 September.</em>&mdash;Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If not watching all the time frequently,
    visit and see that flowers are as placed; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon as possible after
    arrival.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>18 September.</em>&mdash;Just off for train to London. The arrival of Van Helsing&rsquo;s telegram filled me with
    dismay. A whole night lost, and I know by bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is possible
    that all may be well, but what <em>may</em> have happened? Surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us that
    every possible accident should thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with me, and then I can
    complete my entry on Lucy&rsquo;s phonograph.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra.</em></p>

    <p><em>17 September. Night.</em>&mdash;I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no one may by any chance get into
    trouble through me. This is an exact record of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and have
    barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the doing.</p>

    <p>I went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr. Van Helsing directed, and soon fell
    asleep.</p>

    <p>I was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that sleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when
    Mina saved me, and which now I know so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in the next
    room&mdash;as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be&mdash;so that I might have called him. I tried to go to sleep, but
    could not. Then there came to me the old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep would try
    to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be alone, I opened my door and called out: &ldquo;Is there anybody
    there?&rdquo; There was no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again. Then outside in the shrubbery
    I heard a sort of howl like a dog&rsquo;s, but more fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could see
    nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window. So I went back to bed
    again, but determined not to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in; seeing by my moving that
    I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all right.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in and sleep with me, so she came into bed,
    and lay down beside me; she did not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while and then go
    back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window
    again. She was startled and a little frightened, and cried out: &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; I tried to pacify her, and at last
    succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was
    the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a crash at the window, and a lot of broken
    glass was hurled on the floor. The window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the aperture of the
    broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey wolf. Mother cried out
    in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst
    other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore
    it away from me. For a second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and horrible gurgling
    in her throat; then she fell over&mdash;as if struck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy
    for a moment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf
    drew his head back, and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window, and
    wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I
    tried to stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother&rsquo;s poor body, which seemed to grow cold
    already&mdash;for her dear heart had ceased to beat&mdash;weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a
    while.</p>
