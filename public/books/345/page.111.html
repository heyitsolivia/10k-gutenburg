    <p>It is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. Let any obstructing cause, no matter what,
    be removed in any way&mdash;even by death&mdash;and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. More than
    once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream.
    It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker&rsquo;s forehead that I was brought back to reality. Even
    now, when I am gravely revolving the matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble is
    still existent. Even Mrs. Harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when
    something recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. We are to meet here in my study in half an
    hour and decide on our course of action. I see only one immediate difficulty, I know<a name="page_301"
    id="page_301"></a> it by instinct rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear that in
    some mysterious way poor Mrs. Harker&rsquo;s tongue is tied. I <em>know</em> that she forms conclusions of her own, and from
    all that has been I can guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or cannot, give them
    utterance. I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and he and I are to talk it over when we are alone. I suppose it is
    some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. The Count had his own purposes when he
    gave her what Van Helsing called &ldquo;the Vampire&rsquo;s baptism of blood.&rdquo; Well, there may be a poison that distils itself
    out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything! One
    thing I know: that if my instinct be true regarding poor Mrs. Harker&rsquo;s silences, then there is a terrible
    difficulty&mdash;an unknown danger&mdash;in the work before us. The same power that compels her silence may compel
    her speech. I dare not think further; for so I should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman!</p>

    <p>Van Helsing is coming to my study a little before the others. I shall try to open the subject with him.</p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of things. I could see that he had
    something on his mind which he wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating
    about the bush a little, he said suddenly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Friend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone, just at the first at any rate. Later, we may
    have to take the others into our confidence&rdquo;; then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Madam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina is changing.&rdquo; A cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus
    endorsed. Van Helsing continued:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;With the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned before things go too far. Our task is now in
    reality more difficult than ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. I can see the
    characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. It is now but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have
    eyes to notice without to prejudge. Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes are more hard. But these are
    not all, there is to her the silence now often; as so it was with Miss Lucy. She did not speak, even when she wrote
    that which she wished to be known later. Now my fear is this. If it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and hear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her
    first, and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he will, compel her mind to
    disclose to him that which she know?&rdquo; I nodded acquiescence; he went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of our intent, and so she cannot tell what
    she know not. This is a painful task! Oh, so painful that it heart-break me to think of; but it must be. When to-day
    we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council, but be
    simply guarded by us.&rdquo; He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the
    pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured. I knew that it would be some sort of
    comfort to him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for at any rate it would take away the
    pain of doubt. I told him, and the effect was as I expected.</p>

    <p>It is now close to the time of our general gathering. Van Helsing has gone away to prepare for the meeting, and
    his painful part of it. I really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.</p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was experienced by both Van Helsing
    and myself. Mrs. Harker had sent a message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as she
    thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements without her presence to embarrass us. The
    Professor and I looked at each other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. For my own part, I thought
    that if Mrs. Harker realised the danger herself, it was much pain as well as much danger averted. Under the
    circumstances we agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to preserve silence in our
    suspicions, until we should have been able to confer alone again. We went at once into our Plan of Campaign. Van
    Helsing roughly put the facts before us first:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The <em>Czarina Catherine</em> left the Thames yesterday morning. It will take her at the quickest speed she has
    ever made at least three weeks to reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days. Now, if
    we allow for two days less for the ship&rsquo;s voyage, owing to such weather influences as we know that the Count can
    bring to bear; and if we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us, then we have a margin of
    nearly two weeks. Thus, in order to be quite safe, we must leave here on 17th
    at latest. Then we shall at any rate be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such preparations
    as may be necessary. Of course we shall all go armed&mdash;armed against evil things, spiritual as well as
    physical.&rdquo; Here Quincey Morris added:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be that he shall get there before us. I
    propose that we add Winchesters to our armament. I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any trouble
    of that sort around. Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack after us at Tobolsk? What wouldn&rsquo;t we have given
    then for a repeater apiece!&rdquo;</p>
