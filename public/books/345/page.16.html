    <p>Then I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me stupidly and pointed, but just then the &ldquo;hetman&rdquo;
    of the Szgany came out, and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they laughed. Henceforth no
    effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised entreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.
    The leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick rope; these were evidently empty by the ease
    with which the Slovaks handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When they were all unloaded
    and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting
    on it for luck, lazily went each to his horse&rsquo;s head. Shortly afterwards, I heard the cracking of their whips die
    away in the distance.</p>

    
    <p><em>24 June, before morning.</em>&mdash;Last night the Count left me early, and locked himself into his own room.
    As soon as I dared I ran up the winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I thought I would
    watch for the Count, for there is something going on. The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing
    work of some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound as of mattock and spade, and,
    whatever it is, it must be the end of some ruthless villainy.</p>

    <p>I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw something coming out of the Count&rsquo;s window.
    I drew back and watched carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to find that he had on the
    suit of clothes which I had worn whilst travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I had
    seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest, and in my garb, too! This, then, is his new
    scheme of evil: that he will allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave evidence that I have
    been seen in the towns or villages posting my own letters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the
    local people be attributed to me.</p>

    <p>It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up here, a veritable prisoner, but without
    that protection of the law which is even a criminal&rsquo;s right and consolation.</p>

    <p>I thought I would watch for the Count&rsquo;s return, and for a long time sat doggedly at the window. Then I began to
    notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were like the tiniest
    grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a
    sense of soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position,
    so that I could enjoy more fully the aÃ«rial gambolling.</p>

    <p>Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley, which was hidden
    from my sight. Louder it seemed to ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound
    as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul
    was struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I was becoming hypnotised!
    Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom
    beyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes. And then I started, broad awake and
    in full possession of my senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were becoming gradually
    materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt
    somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly.</p>

    <p>When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the Count&rsquo;s room, something like a sharp wail
    quickly suppressed; and then there was silence, deep, awful silence, which
    chilled me. With a beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and could do nothing. I sat down
    and simply cried.</p>

    <p>As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without&mdash;the agonised cry of a woman. I rushed to the window, and
    throwing it up, peered out between the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her hands
    over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face
    at the window she threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Monster, give me my child!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart.
    Then she tore her hair and beat her breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion.
    Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands
    against the door.</p>

    <p>Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the Count calling in his harsh, metallic
    whisper. His call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes had passed a
    pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard.</p>

    <p>There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but short. Before long they streamed away
    singly, licking their lips.</p>

    <p>I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and she was better dead.</p>

    <p>What shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful thing of night and gloom and fear?</p>

    
    <p><em>25 June, morning.</em>&mdash;No man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and how dear to his
    heart and eye the morning can be. When the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway
    opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My
    fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must take action of some
    sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of
    that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth.</p>

    <p>Let me not think of it. Action!</p>

    <p>It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I
    have not yet seen the Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that he may be awake whilst
    they sleep? If I could only get into his room! But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for
    me.</p>

    <p>Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone why may not another body go? I have seen
    him myself crawl from his window. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The chances are desperate,
    but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk it. At the worst it can only be death; and a man&rsquo;s death is not a
    calf&rsquo;s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me in my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail;
    good-bye, my faithful friend and second father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!</p>
