    <p>After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And now tell me all about him.&rdquo; When it came to speaking to this great learned man, I began to fear that he
    would think me a weak fool, and Jonathan a madman&mdash;that journal is all so strange&mdash;and I hesitated to go
    on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I trusted him, so I said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not laugh at me or at my husband. I have been
    since yesterday in a sort of fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I have even half
    believed some very strange things.&rdquo; He reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which I am here, it is you who would laugh. I
    have learned not to think little of any one&rsquo;s belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep an open
    mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it, but the strange things, the extraordinary
    things, the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my mind. If you will let me, I shall give
    you a paper to read. It is long, but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and Jonathan&rsquo;s. It is
    the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that happened. I dare not say
    anything of it; you will read for yourself and judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and
    tell me what you think.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; he said as I gave him the papers; &ldquo;I shall in the morning, so soon as I can, come to see you and
    your husband, if I may.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch with us and see him then; you could catch
    the quick 3:34 train, which will leave you at Paddington before eight.&rdquo; He was surprised at my knowledge of the
    trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made up all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help
    Jonathan in case he is in a hurry.</p>

    <p>So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here thinking&mdash;thinking I don&rsquo;t know what.</p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;<em>25 September, 6 o&rsquo;clock.</em></p>

    <p class="nind">&ldquo;Dear Madam Mina,&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have read your husband&rsquo;s so wonderful diary. You may sleep without doubt. Strange and terrible as it is, it is
    <em>true</em>! I will pledge my life on it. It may be worse for others; but for him and you there is no dread. He is a
    noble fellow; and let me tell you from experience of men, that one who would do as he did in going down that wall
    and to that room&mdash;ay, and going a second time&mdash;is not one to be injured in permanence by a shock. His
    brain and his heart are all right; this I swear, before I have even seen him; so be at rest. I shall have much to
    ask him of other things. I am blessed that to-day I come to see you, for I have learn all at once so much that again
    I am dazzle&mdash;dazzle more than ever, and I must think.</p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;Yours the most faithful,&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Abraham Van Helsing.</span>&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Letter, Mrs. Harker to Van Helsing.</em></p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;<em>25 September, 6:30 p. m.</em></p>

    <p class="nind">&ldquo;My dear Dr. Van Helsing,&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken a great weight off my mind. And yet, if it be true, what
    terrible things there are in the world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really in London! I
    fear to think. I have this moment, whilst writing, had a wire from Jonathan, saying<a name="page_175"
    id="page_175"></a> that he leaves by the 6:25 to-night from Launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that I shall
    have no fear to-night. Will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come to breakfast at eight o&rsquo;clock,
    if this be not too early for you? You can get away, if you are in a hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring you
    to Paddington by 2:35. Do not answer this, as I shall take it that, if I do not hear, you will come to
    breakfast.</p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;Believe me,&ldquo;Your faithful and grateful friend,&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mina Harker</span>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Jonathan Harker&rsquo;s Journal.</em></p>

    <p><em>26 September.</em>&mdash;I thought never to write in this diary again, but the time has come. When I got home
    last night Mina had supper ready, and when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing&rsquo;s visit, and of her having given
    him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been about me. She showed me in the doctor&rsquo;s letter that
    all I wrote down was true. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the reality of the whole
    thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in the dark, and distrustful. But, now that I <em>know</em>, I am not
    afraid, even of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting to London, and it was he I
    saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what
    Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and
    bring him over....</p>

    <p>He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he was, and introduced myself, he took me
    by the shoulder, and turned my face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.&rdquo; It was so funny to hear my wife called &ldquo;Madam
    Mina&rdquo; by this kindly, strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I <em>was</em> ill, I <em>have</em> had a shock; but you have cured me already.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And how?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything took a hue of unreality, and I did not
    know what to trust, even the evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know what to do; and so
    had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I
    mistrusted myself. Doctor, you don&rsquo;t know what it is to doubt everything, even
    yourself. No, you don&rsquo;t; you couldn&rsquo;t with eyebrows like yours.&rdquo; He seemed pleased, and laughed as he
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with so much pleasure coming to you to
    breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.&rdquo; I would listen
    to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded and stood silent.</p>
