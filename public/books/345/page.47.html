    <p><em>17 September.</em>&mdash;Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong again that I hardly know myself.
    It is as if I had passed through some long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel
    the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing;
    darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant: and then long spells
    of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since, however, Dr.
    Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me
    out of my wits&mdash;the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed so close to me, the harsh
    sounds that came from I know not where and commanded me to do I know not what&mdash;<a name="page_127"
    id="page_127"></a>have all ceased. I go to bed now without any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I
    have grown quite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from Haarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is
    going away, as he has to be for a day in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left alone.
    Thank God for mother&rsquo;s sake, and dear Arthur&rsquo;s, and for all our friends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel
    the change, for last night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found him asleep twice when I
    awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again, although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily
    against the window-panes.</p>

    <p class="letra">THE ESCAPED WOLF.<small>PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.</small></p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Interview with the Keeper in the Zoölogical Gardens.</em></p>

    <p>After many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using the words &ldquo;Pall Mall Gazette&rdquo; as a sort
    of talisman, I managed to find the keeper of the section of the Zoölogical Gardens in which the wolf department is
    included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just
    sitting down to his tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk, elderly, and without children,
    and if the specimen I enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty comfortable.
    The keeper would not enter on what he called &ldquo;business&rdquo; until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then
    when the table was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You&rsquo;ll excoose me refoosin&rsquo; to talk of perfeshunal subjects
    afore meals. I gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore I begins to arsk
    them questions.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How do you mean, ask them questions?&rdquo; I queried, wishful to get him into a talkative humour.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ittin&rsquo; of them over the &rsquo;ead with a pole is one way; scratchin&rsquo; of their hears is another, when gents as
    is flush wants a bit of a show-orf to their gals. I don&rsquo;t so much mind the fust&mdash;the &rsquo;ittin&rsquo; with a pole afore
    I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad their sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the ear-scratchin&rsquo;. Mind you,&rdquo; he added philosophically, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a deal
    of the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here&rsquo;s you a-comin&rsquo; and arskin&rsquo; of me questions about my
    business, and I that grumpy-like that only for your bloomin&rsquo; &rsquo;arf-quid I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; seen you blowed fust &rsquo;fore I&rsquo;d
    answer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I&rsquo;d like you to arsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me
    questions. Without offence did I tell yer to go to &rsquo;ell?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You did.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; when you said you&rsquo;d report me for usin&rsquo; of obscene language that was &rsquo;ittin&rsquo; me over the &rsquo;ead; but the
    &rsquo;arf-quid made that all right. I weren&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my &rsquo;owl as the
    wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor&rsquo; love yer &rsquo;art, now that the old &rsquo;ooman has stuck a chunk of her
    tea-cake in me, an&rsquo; rinsed me out with her bloomin&rsquo; old teapot, and I&rsquo;ve lit hup, you may scratch my ears for all
    you&rsquo;re worth, and won&rsquo;t git even a growl out of me. Drive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin&rsquo; at,
    that &rsquo;ere escaped wolf.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it happened; and when I know the facts I&rsquo;ll get
    you to say what you consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will end.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;All right, guv&rsquo;nor. This &rsquo;ere is about the &rsquo;ole story. That &rsquo;ere wolf what we called Bersicker was one of three
    grey ones that came from Norway to Jamrach&rsquo;s, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a nice well-behaved
    wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I&rsquo;m more surprised at &rsquo;im for wantin&rsquo; to get out nor any other animile
    in the place. But, there, you can&rsquo;t trust wolves no more nor women.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mind him, sir!&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s got mindin&rsquo; the animiles so long
    that blest if he ain&rsquo;t like a old wolf &rsquo;isself! But there ain&rsquo;t no &rsquo;arm in &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin&rsquo; yesterday when I first hear my disturbance. I was makin&rsquo; up a
    litter in the monkey-house for a young puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin&rsquo; and &rsquo;owlin&rsquo; I kem away
    straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin&rsquo; like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn&rsquo;t much
    people about that day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a &rsquo;ook nose and a pointed beard,
    with a few white hairs runnin&rsquo; through it. He had a &rsquo;ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to
    him, for it seemed as if it was &rsquo;im as they was hirritated at. He &rsquo;ad white kid
    gloves on &rsquo;is &rsquo;ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says: ‘Keeper, these wolves seem upset at
    something.&rsquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;‘Maybe it&rsquo;s you,&rsquo; says I, for I did not like the airs as he give &rsquo;isself. He didn&rsquo;t git angry, as I &rsquo;oped
    he would, but he smiled a kind of insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. ‘Oh no, they wouldn&rsquo;t
    like me,&rsquo; &rsquo;e says.</p>
