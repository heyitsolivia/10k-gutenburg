    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;I must have fallen asleep, for I was awaked by Mina, who was sitting up in bed, with a
    startled look on her face. I could see easily, for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed a warning
    hand over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hush! there is someone in the corridor!&rdquo; I got up softly, and crossing the room, gently opened the door.</p>

    <p>Just outside, stretched on a mattress, lay Mr. Morris, wide awake. He raised a warning hand for silence as he
    whispered to me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hush! go back to bed; it is all right. One of us will be here all night. We don&rsquo;t mean to take any
    chances!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>His look and gesture forbade discussion, so I came back and told Mina. She sighed and positively a shadow of a
    smile stole over her poor, pale face as she put her arms round me and said softly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, thank God for good brave men!&rdquo; With a sigh she sank back again to sleep. I write this now as I am not
    sleepy, though I must try again.</p>

    
    <p><em>4 October, morning.</em>&mdash;Once again during the night I was wakened by Mina. This time we had all had a
    good sleep, for the grey of the coming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was like a
    speck rather than a disc of light. She said to me hurriedly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Go, call the Professor. I want to see him at once.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have an idea. I suppose it must have come in the night, and matured without my knowing it. He must hypnotise
    me before the dawn, and then I shall be able to speak. Go quick, dearest; the time is getting close.&rdquo; I went to the
    door. Dr. Seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing me, he sprang to his feet.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Is anything wrong?&rdquo; he asked, in alarm.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;but Mina wants to see Dr. Van Helsing at once.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; he said, and hurried into the Professor&rsquo;s room.</p>

    <p>In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his dressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming
    were with Dr. Seward at the door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina a smile&mdash;a positive smile ousted
    the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan, we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of
    old, back to us to-day!&rdquo; Then turning to her, he said, cheerfully: &ldquo;And what am I do for you? For at this hour you
    do not want me for nothings.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I want you to hypnotise me!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do it before the dawn, for I feel that then I can speak, and speak
    freely. Be quick, for the time is short!&rdquo; Without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed.</p>

    <p>Looking fixedly at her, he commenced to make passes in front of her, from over the top of her head downward, with
    each hand in turn. Mina gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes, during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer,
    for I felt that some crisis was at hand. Gradually her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle
    heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive. The Professor made a few more passes and then stopped, and I
    could see that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration. Mina opened her eyes; but she did not seem
    the same woman. There was a far-away look in her eyes, and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me.
    Raising his hand to impose silence, the Professor motioned to me to bring the
    others in. They came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the foot of the bed, looking on. Mina
    appeared not to see them. The stillness was broken by Van Helsing&rsquo;s voice speaking in a low level tone which would
    not break the current of her thoughts:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; The answer came in a neutral way:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I do not know. Sleep has no place it can call its own.&rdquo; For several minutes there was silence. Mina sat rigid,
    and the Professor stood staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. The room was growing
    lighter; without taking his eyes from Mina&rsquo;s face, Dr. Van Helsing motioned me to pull up the blind. I did so, and
    the day seemed just upon us. A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through the room. On
    the instant the Professor spoke again:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Where are you now?&rdquo; The answer came dreamily, but with intention; it were as though she were interpreting
    something. I have heard her use the same tone when reading her shorthand notes.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I do not know. It is all strange to me!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I can see nothing; it is all dark.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What do you hear?&rdquo; I could detect the strain in the Professor&rsquo;s patient voice.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The lapping of water. It is gurgling by, and little waves leap. I can hear them on the outside.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Then you are on a ship?&rdquo; We all looked at each other, trying to glean something each from the other. We were
    afraid to think. The answer came quick:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What else do you hear?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. There is the creaking of a chain, and the loud tinkle as
    the check of the capstan falls into the rachet.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am still&mdash;oh, so still. It is like death!&rdquo; The voice faded away into a deep breath as of one sleeping,
    and the open eyes closed again.</p>

    <p>By this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of day. Dr. Van Helsing placed his hands on
    Mina&rsquo;s shoulders, and laid her head down softly on her pillow. She lay like a sleeping child for a few moments, and
    then, with a long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around her. &ldquo;Have I been talking in my sleep?&rdquo; was
    all she said. She seemed, however, to know the situation without telling,
    though she was eager to know what she had told. The Professor repeated the conversation, and she said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Then there is not a moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!&rdquo; Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming started for the
    door but the Professor&rsquo;s calm voice called them back:&mdash;</p>
