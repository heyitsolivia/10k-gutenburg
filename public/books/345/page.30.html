    
    <p><em>29 July</em>.&mdash;Another tragedy. Had single watch to-night, as crew too tired to double. When morning watch
    came on deck could find no one except steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on
    deck. Thorough search, but no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate and I agreed to go
    armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.</p>

    
    <p><em>30 July</em>.&mdash;Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather fine, all sails set. Retired worn out;
    slept soundly; awaked by mate telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and two
    hands left to work ship.</p>

    
    <p><em>1 August</em>.&mdash;Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when in the English Channel to be able
    to signal for help or get in somewhere. Not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower, as
    could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible doom. Mate now more demoralised than either of
    men. His stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear, working stolidly and
    patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are Russian, he Roumanian.</p>

    
    <p><em>2 August, midnight</em>.&mdash;Woke up from few minutes&rsquo; sleep by hearing a cry, seemingly outside my port.
    Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and ran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on
    watch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits of Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he
    saw North Foreland, just as he heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and only God can guide
    us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God seems to have deserted us.</p>

    
    <p><em>3 August</em>.&mdash;At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and when I got to it found no one
    there. The wind was steady, and as we ran before it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the
    mate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He looked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear
    his reason has given way. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my ear, as though fearing
    the very air might hear: &ldquo;<em>It</em> is here; I know it, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and
    thin, and ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind It, and gave It my knife; but the knife
    went through It, empty as the air.&rdquo; And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space. Then he went
    on: &ldquo;But It is here, and I&rsquo;ll find It. It is in the hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I&rsquo;ll unscrew them one by one and see. You work the helm.&rdquo; And, with a warning look and his finger on
    his lip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could not leave the helm. I saw him come out on
    deck again with a tool-chest and a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark, raving mad, and it&rsquo;s
    no use my trying to stop him. He can&rsquo;t hurt those big boxes: they are invoiced as &ldquo;clay,&rdquo; and to pull them about is
    as harmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and write these notes. I can only trust in God
    and wait till the fog clears. Then, if I can&rsquo;t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut down sails
    and lie by, and signal for help....</p>

    
    <p>It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmer&mdash;for I heard
    him knocking away at something in the hold, and work is good for him&mdash;there came up the hatchway a sudden,
    startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he came as if shot from a gun&mdash;a raging
    madman, with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear. &ldquo;Save me! save me!&rdquo; he cried, and then looked round
    on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in a steady voice he said: &ldquo;You had better come too,
    captain, before it is too late. <em>He</em> is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me from Him, and it is
    all that is left!&rdquo; Before I could say a word, or move forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and
    deliberately threw himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was this madman who had got rid of
    the men one by one, and now he has followed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these horrors
    when I get to port? <em>When</em> I get to port! Will that ever be?</p>

    
    <p><em>4 August.</em>&mdash;Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there is sunrise because I am a sailor,
    why else I know not. I dared not go below, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in the
    dimness of the night I saw It&mdash;Him! God forgive me, but the mate was right to jump overboard. It was better to
    die like a man; to die like a sailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must not leave my
    ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to
    fail, and along with them I shall tie that which He&mdash;It!&mdash;dare not touch; and then, come good wind or
    foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I am growing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can
    look me in the face again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked,
    mayhap this bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not, ... well, then all men shall know
    that I have been true to my trust. God and the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do
    his duty....</p>

    
    <p>Of course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce; and whether or not the man himself
    committed the murders there is now none to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is simply a
    hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of
    boats up the Esk for a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey steps; for he is to be buried
    in the churchyard on the cliff. The owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as wishing
    to follow him to the grave.</p>

    <p>No trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much mourning, for, with public opinion in its
    present state, he would, I believe, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and so will end this one
    more &ldquo;mystery of the sea.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><em>8 August.</em>&mdash;Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not sleep. The storm was fearful, and
    as it boomed loudly among the chimney-pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a
    distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up twice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I
    awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. It is a very strange thing,
    this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,
    disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her life.</p>
