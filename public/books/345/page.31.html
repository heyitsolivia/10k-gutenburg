    <p>Early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night.
    There were very few people about, and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big, grim-looking
    waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the
    narrow mouth of the harbour&mdash;like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow I felt glad that Jonathan was
    not on the sea last night, but on land. But, oh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully
    anxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!</p>

    
    <p><em>10 August.</em>&mdash;The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most touching. Every boat in the harbour
    seemed to be there, and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the churchyard.
    Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst the cort√®ge of boats went up the river to the Viaduct
    and came down again. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way. The poor fellow was laid to
    rest quite near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.
    She was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her. She
    is quite odd in one thing: she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if there be, she
    does not understand it herself. There is an additional cause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning
    on our seat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said, fallen back in the seat in some sort of
    fright, for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor dear old man!
    Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely
    than other people do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did not much heed, though I am myself
    very fond of animals. One of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog. The dog
    is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the
    service the dog would not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few yards off, barking and
    howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to
    make a noise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs bristling out like a cat&rsquo;s tail when
    puss is on the war-path. Finally the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then took it by
    the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it
    touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did not try to get away, but crouched
    down, quivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect, to
    comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised
    sort of way. I greatly fear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble. She
    will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The whole agglomeration of things&mdash;the ship steered into port by a dead man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the
    touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror&mdash;will all afford material for her dreams.</p>

    <p>I think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I shall take her for a long walk by the
    cliffs to Robin Hood&rsquo;s Bay and back. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.</p>

    <p><em>Same day, 11 o&rsquo;clock p. m.</em>&mdash;Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I had made my diary a duty I
    should not open it to-night. We had a lovely walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some
    dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us. I
    believe we forgot everything except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a
    fresh start. We had a capital &ldquo;severe tea&rdquo; at Robin Hood&rsquo;s Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a
    bow-window right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. I believe we should have shocked the &ldquo;New Woman&rdquo; with
    our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,
    and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls. Lucy was really tired, and we intended to creep off to
    bed as soon as we could. The young curate came in, however, and Mrs. Westenra asked him to stay for supper. Lucy and
    I had both a fight for it with the dusty miller; I know it was a hard fight on my part, and I am quite heroic. I
    think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates, who don&rsquo;t take
    supper, no matter how they may be pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. Lucy is asleep and breathing
    softly. She has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and looks, oh, so sweet. If Mr. Holmwood fell in love with her
    seeing her only in the drawing-room, I wonder what he would say if he saw her now. Some of the &ldquo;New Women&rdquo; writers
    will some day start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or
    accepting. But I suppose the New Woman won&rsquo;t condescend in future to accept; she will do the proposing herself. And
    a nice job she will make of it, too! There&rsquo;s some consolation in that. I am so happy to-night, because dear Lucy
    seems better. I really believe she has turned the corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. I should
    be quite happy if I only knew if Jonathan.... God bless and keep him.</p>
