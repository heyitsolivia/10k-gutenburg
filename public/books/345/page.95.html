    <p>The man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient. The wounds of the face was superficial;
    the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The Professor
    thought a moment and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion
    shows the terrible nature of his injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the brain will
    increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be too late.&rdquo; As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at
    the door. I went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and Quincey in pajamas and slippers:
    the former spoke:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident. So I woke Quincey or rather called for him
    as he was not asleep. Things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times.
    I&rsquo;ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things as they have been. We&rsquo;ll have to look back&mdash;and
    forward a little more than we have done. May we come in?&rdquo; I nodded, and held the door open till they had entered;
    then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the
    floor, he said softly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!&rdquo; I told him briefly, and added that we expected he would
    recover consciousness after the operation&mdash;for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat down on the
    edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched in patience.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We shall wait,&rdquo; said Van Helsing, &ldquo;just long enough to fix the best spot
    for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot; for it is evident that the
    h√¶morrhage is increasing.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a horrible sinking in my heart, and from
    Van Helsing&rsquo;s face I gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded the words
    that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think; but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I
    have read of men who have heard the death-watch. The poor man&rsquo;s breathing came in uncertain gasps. Each instant he
    seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he would
    relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon
    me. I could almost hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows
    from a hammer. The silence finally became agonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from
    their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture. There was a nervous suspense over us all,
    as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it.</p>

    <p>At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast; he might die at any moment. I
    looked up at the Professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he spoke:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have been thinking so, as I stood here. It may be
    there is a soul at stake! We shall operate just above the ear.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Without another word he made the operation. For a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous. Then
    there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest. Suddenly his eyes opened,
    and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare. This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad
    surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved convulsively, and as he did so, said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I have had a terrible dream, and it has left
    me so weak that I cannot move. What&rsquo;s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts dreadfully.&rdquo; He tried
    to turn his head; but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van
    Helsing said in a quiet grave tone:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.&rdquo; As he heard the voice his face brightened, through its mutilation, and he
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some water, my lips are dry; and I shall try
    to tell you. I dreamed&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey&mdash;&ldquo;The brandy&mdash;it
    is in my study&mdash;quick!&rdquo; He flew and returned with a glass, the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We
    moistened the parched lips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor injured brain had
    been working in the interval, for, when he was quite conscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised
    confusion which I shall never forget, and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.&rdquo; Then his eyes roved round the room; as they
    caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If I were not sure already, I would know from them.&rdquo; For an instant his eyes closed&mdash;not with pain or sleep
    but voluntarily, as though he were bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said, hurriedly, and
    with more energy than he had yet displayed:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes; and then I must go back to
    death&mdash;or worse! Wet my lips with brandy again. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my
    poor crushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left me, when I implored you to let me go
    away. I couldn&rsquo;t speak then, for I felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as I am now.
    I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to
    me. My brain seemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the dogs bark behind our house, but
    not where He was!&rdquo; As he spoke, Van Helsing&rsquo;s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and gripped it
    hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly and said: &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; in a low voice. Renfield
    proceeded:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before; but he was solid then&mdash;not a ghost,
    and his eyes were fierce like a man&rsquo;s when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white teeth glinted
    in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn&rsquo;t ask
    him to come in at first, though I knew he wanted to&mdash;just as he had wanted all along. Then he<a name="page_260"
    id="page_260"></a> began promising me things&mdash;not in words but by doing them.&rdquo; He was interrupted by a word
    from the Professor:&mdash;</p>
