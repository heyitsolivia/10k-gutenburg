    <p>&ldquo;Not for your life!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;not for your living soul and hers!&rdquo; And he stood between them like a lion at
    bay.</p>

    <p>Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do or say; and before any impulse of violence
    could seize him he realised the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.</p>

    <p>I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face;
    the sharp teeth champed together. Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.</p>

    <p>Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van
    Helsing&rsquo;s great brown one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. &ldquo;My true friend,&rdquo; she said, in a faint voice, but with
    untellable pathos, &ldquo;My true friend, and his! Oh, guard him, and give me peace!<a name="page_151"
    id="page_151"></a>&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I swear it!&rdquo; he said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his hand, as one who registers an oath. Then
    he turned to Arthur, and said to him: &ldquo;Come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the forehead, and
    only once.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.</p>

    <p>Lucy&rsquo;s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took Arthur&rsquo;s arm, and drew him away.</p>

    <p>And then Lucy&rsquo;s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it ceased.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It is all over,&rdquo; said Van Helsing. &ldquo;She is dead!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he sat down, and covered his face with his
    hands, sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see.</p>

    <p>I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy, and his face was sterner than ever. Some
    change had come over her body. Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had recovered some
    of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their deadly pallor. It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the
    working of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be.</p>

    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza"><span class="i0">&ldquo;We thought her dying whilst she slept,</span><span class="i4">And sleeping
      when she died.&rdquo;</span></div>
    </div>
    <p>I stood beside Van Helsing, and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. It is the end!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Not so; alas! not so. It is only the beginning!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We can do nothing as yet. Wait and see.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<small>DR. SEWARD&rsquo;S
    DIARY&mdash;<em>continued</em>.</small></h2>
    <p class="nind">T<small>HE</small> funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and her mother
    might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff
    were afflicted&mdash;or blessed&mdash;with something of his own obsequious suavity. Even the woman who performed the
    last offices for the dead remarked to me, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out from
    the death-chamber:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;She makes a very beautiful corpse, sir. It&rsquo;s quite a privilege to attend on her. It&rsquo;s not too much to say that
    she will do credit to our establishment!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from the disordered state of things in the
    household. There were no relatives at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his father&rsquo;s
    funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden. Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I
    took it upon ourselves to examine papers, etc. He insisted upon looking over Lucy&rsquo;s papers himself. I asked him why,
    for I feared that he, being a foreigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and so might in
    ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. He answered me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I know; I know. You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor. But this is not altogether for the law. You
    knew that, when you avoided the coroner. I have more than him to avoid. There may be papers more&mdash;such as
    this.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>As he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been in Lucy&rsquo;s breast, and which she had torn
    in her sleep.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;When you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs. Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him
    to-night. For me, I watch here in the room and in Miss Lucy&rsquo;s old room all night, and I myself search for what may
    be. It is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found the name and address of Mrs. Westenra&rsquo;s
    solicitor and had written to him. All the poor lady&rsquo;s papers were in order;
    explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given. I had hardly sealed the letter, when, to my surprise,
    Van Helsing walked into the room, saying:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Can I help you, friend John? I am free, and if I may, my service is to you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Have you got what you looked for?&rdquo; I asked, to which he replied:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I did not look for any specific thing. I only hoped to find, and find I have, all that there was&mdash;only some
    letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say nothing
    of them. I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And now, friend John, I think we may to bed. We want sleep, both you and I, and rest to recuperate. To-morrow we
    shall have much to do, but for the to-night there is no need of us. Alas!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Before turning in we went to look at poor Lucy. The undertaker had certainly done his work well, for the room was
    turned into a small <em>chapelle ardente</em>. There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers, and death was made
    as little repulsive as might be. The end of the winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over
    and turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light
    to note it well. All Lucy&rsquo;s loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed, instead of
    leaving traces of &ldquo;decay&rsquo;s effacing fingers,&rdquo; had but restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not
    believe my eyes that I was looking at a corpse.</p>
