    <p><em>30 September.</em>&mdash;Mr. Harker arrived at nine o&rsquo;clock. He had got his wife&rsquo;s wire just before starting.
    He is uncommonly clever, if one can judge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true&mdash;and
    judging by one&rsquo;s own wonderful experiences, it must be&mdash;he is also a man of great nerve. That going down to the
    vault a second time was a remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was prepared to meet a good
    specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet, business-like gentleman who came here to-day.<a name="page_210"
    id="page_210"></a></p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room, and as I passed a while ago I
    heard the click of the typewriter. They are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in
    chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes
    at Whitby and the carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife&rsquo;s typescript of my diary. I
    wonder what they make out of it. Here it is....</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the Count&rsquo;s hiding-place! Goodness knows that
      we had enough clues from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters relating to the purchase of
      the house were with the typescript. Oh, if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy! Stop; that
      way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will
      be able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he
      has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet, but when I get at the dates
      I suppose I shall. What a good thing that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have found the
      dates otherwise....</p>

      <p>I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed
      as sane as any one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects, all of which he treated
      naturally. He then, of his own accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge
      during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had
      I not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts, I should have been prepared to
      sign for him after a brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All those outbreaks were in some
      way linked with the proximity of the Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that his instinct
      is satisfied as to the vampire&rsquo;s ultimate triumph? Stay; he is himself zo√∂phagous, and in his wild ravings outside
      the chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of &ldquo;master.&rdquo; This all seems confirmation of our idea.
      However, after a while I came away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe him
      too deep with questions. He might begin to think, and then&mdash;! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of
      his; so I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to have a strait-waistcoat ready in case
      of need.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Jonathan Harker&rsquo;s Journal.</em></p>

    <p><em>29 September, in train to London.</em>&mdash;When I received Mr. Billington&rsquo;s courteous message that he would
    give me any information in his power I thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such inquiries as
    I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the Count&rsquo;s to its place in London. Later, we may be
    able to deal with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and brought me to his father&rsquo;s house,
    where they had decided that I must stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality: give a
    guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short,
    and Mr. Billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes. It gave me almost a
    turn to see again one of the letters which I had seen on the Count&rsquo;s table before I knew of his diabolical plans.
    Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and with precision. He seemed to have been
    prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out. To use
    an Americanism, he had &ldquo;taken no chances,&rdquo; and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was
    simply the logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it: &ldquo;Fifty cases of common earth, to be
    used for experimental purposes.&rdquo; Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of these I got
    copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could give me, so I went down to the port and saw the
    coastguards, the Customs officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the strange entry of the
    ship, which is already taking its place in local tradition; but no one could add to the simple description &ldquo;Fifty
    cases of common earth.&rdquo; I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in communication with the men who had
    actually received the boxes. Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that the boxes
    were &ldquo;main and mortal heavy,&rdquo; and that shifting them was dry work. One of them added that it was hard lines that
    there wasn&rsquo;t any gentleman &ldquo;such-like as yourself, squire,&rdquo; to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a
    liquid form; another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had
    not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source
    of reproach.</p>

    
    <p><em>30 September.</em>&mdash;The station-master was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the
    station-master at King&rsquo;s Cross, so that when I arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival
    of the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper officials, and I saw that their tally was
    correct with the original invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited; a noble
    use of them had, however, been made, and again I was compelled to deal with the result in an <em>ex post facto</em>
    manner.</p>

    <p>From thence I went on to Carter Paterson&rsquo;s central office, where I met with the utmost courtesy. They looked up
    the transaction in their day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King&rsquo;s Cross office for more
    details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them
    over, sending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at
    Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing exactly; the carriers&rsquo; men were able to supplement the paucity of the
    written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the
    job, and of the consequent thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity, through the medium of
    the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men
    remarked:&mdash;</p>
