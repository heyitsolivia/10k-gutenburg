    <p>&ldquo;Quincey and I will find a locksmith. You had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty; for
    under the circumstances it wouldn&rsquo;t seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. But you are a solicitor and the
    Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you should have known better.&rdquo; I demurred as to my not sharing any
    danger even of odium, but he went on: &ldquo;Besides, it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us. My
    title will make it all right with the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. You had better go with
    Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park, somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened
    and the smith has gone away, do you all come across. We shall be on the lookout for you, and shall let you in.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The advice is good!&rdquo; said Van Helsing, so we said no more. Godalming and Morris hurried off in a cab, we
    following in another. At the corner of Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green Park. My
    heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted
    condition amongst its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. We sat down on a bench within good view, and began
    to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible. The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we
    waited for the coming of the others.</p>

    <p>At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up. Out of it, in leisurely fashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and
    down from the box descended a thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. Morris paid the cabman, who
    touched his hat and drove away. Together the two ascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted
    done. The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail, saying something to a
    policeman who just then sauntered along. The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down placed his bag
    beside him. After searching through it, he took out a selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in
    orderly fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and turning to his employers, made some
    remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he began to
    probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third.
    All at once the door opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others entered the hall. We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van Helsing&rsquo;s went cold
    altogether. We waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring in his bag. Then he held the door partly
    open, steadying it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock. This he finally handed to Lord Godalming, who
    took out his purse and gave him something. The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat and departed; not
    a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction.</p>

    <p>When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at the door. It was immediately opened by
    Quincey Morris, beside whom stood Lord Godalming lighting a cigar.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The place smells so vilely,&rdquo; said the latter as we came in. It did indeed smell vilely&mdash;like the old chapel
    at Carfax&mdash;and with our previous experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using the place pretty
    freely. We moved to explore the house, all keeping together in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily
    enemy to deal with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be in the house. In the dining-room,
    which lay at the back of the hall, we found eight boxes of earth. Eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!
    Our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the missing box. First we opened the shutters
    of the window which looked out across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of a stable, pointed to look
    like the front of a miniature house. There were no windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. We did
    not lose any time in examining the chests. With the tools which we had brought with us we opened them, one by one,
    and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the Count was not at
    present in the house, and we proceeded to search for any of his effects.</p>

    <p>After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic, we came to the conclusion that the
    dining-room contained any effects which might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine them.
    They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room table. There were title deeds of the Piccadilly
    house in a great bundle; deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey; note-paper, envelopes, and
    pens and ink. All were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. There were also a clothes
    brush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin&mdash;the latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with
    blood. Last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to the other houses.
    When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris taking
    accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great
    bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. The rest of us are, with what patience we can, waiting
    their return&mdash;or the coming of the Count.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII<small>DR. SEWARD&rsquo;S DIARY</small></h2>
    <p><em>3 October.</em>&mdash;The time seemed terrible long whilst we were waiting for the coming of Godalming and
    Quincey Morris. The Professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time. I could see his beneficent
    purpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker. The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery
    that is appalling to see. Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful face, full of energy,
    and with dark brown hair. To-day he is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow
    burning eyes and grief-written lines of his face. His energy is still intact; in fact, he is like a living flame.
    This may yet be his salvation, for, if all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then, in a
    kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. Poor fellow, I thought my own trouble was bad enough, but
    his&mdash;&mdash;! The Professor knows this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. What he has
    been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. So well as I can remember, here it is:&mdash;</p>
