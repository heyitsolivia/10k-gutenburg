    <p>&ldquo;We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the
    lion fights, for lordship. Here, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland the
    fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the
    seaboards of Europe, ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the were-wolves themselves had
    come. Here, too, when they came, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,
    till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had
    mated with the devils in the desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as Attila, whose blood
    is in these veins?&rdquo; He held up his arms. &ldquo;Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that
    when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his
    thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the
    Hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed there? And
    when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us
    for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more than that, endless duty of the
    frontier guard, for, as the Turks say, ‘water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.&rsquo; Who more gladly than we throughout
    the Four Nations received the ‘bloody sword,&rsquo; or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King?
    When was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar
    went down beneath the Crescent? Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the
    Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen,
    sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula, indeed, who inspired
    that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land;
    who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field
    where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They said that he
    thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants without a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart
    to conduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Mohács, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood
    were amongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the
    Szekelys&mdash;and the Dracula as their heart&rsquo;s blood, their brains, and their swords&mdash;can boast a record that
    mushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over. Blood is too
    precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is
    told.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (<em>Mem.</em>, this diary seems horribly like the
    beginning of the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; for everything has to break off at cockcrow&mdash;or like the ghost of Hamlet&rsquo;s
    father.)</p>

    
    <p><em>12 May.</em>&mdash;Let me begin with facts&mdash;bare, meagre facts, verified by books and figures, and of
    which there can be no doubt. I must not confuse them with experiences which
    will have to rest on my own observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from his room he
    began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day
    wearily over books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the matters I had been examined in at
    Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn. There was a certain method in the Count&rsquo;s inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in sequence; the
    knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.</p>

    <p>First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I told him he might have a dozen if he
    wished, but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only one could
    act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest. He seemed thoroughly to
    understand, and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend, say, to
    banking, and another to look after shipping, in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the
    banking solicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any chance mislead him, so he
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral
    at Exeter, which is far from London, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now here let me
    say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have sought the services of one so far off from London instead
    of some one resident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only; and as one
    of London residence might, perhaps, have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to seek my
    agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods,
    say, to Newcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more ease be done by
    consigning to one in these ports?&rdquo; I answered that certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a
    system of agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor, so
    that the client, simply placing himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by him without
    further trouble.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I replied; and &ldquo;such is often done by men of business, who do
    not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through,
    and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded against. I explained all
    these things to him to the best of my ability, and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made
    a wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee. For a man who was never in the
    country, and who did not evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were wonderful. When he
    had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books
    available, he suddenly stood up and said:&mdash;</p>
