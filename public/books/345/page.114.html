    <p>&ldquo;What is that time?&rdquo; The voice was Quincey&rsquo;s, but it was low and strained.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;When you shall be convinced that I am so changed that it is better that I die that I may live. When I am thus
    dead in the flesh, then you will, without a moment&rsquo;s delay, drive a stake through me and cut off my head; or do
    whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt down before her and taking her hand in his said
    solemnly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a rough fellow, who hasn&rsquo;t, perhaps, lived as a man should to win such a distinction, but I swear to
    you by all that I hold sacred and dear that, should the time ever come, I shall not<a name="page_310"
    id="page_310"></a> flinch from the duty that you have set us. And I promise you, too, that I shall make all certain,
    for if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has come!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My true friend!&rdquo; was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as, bending over, she kissed his hand.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!&rdquo; said Van Helsing.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And I!&rdquo; said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath. I followed, myself. Then her
    husband turned to her wan-eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of his hair, and
    asked:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And must I, too, make such a promise, oh, my wife?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You too, my dearest,&rdquo; she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her voice and eyes. &ldquo;You must not shrink. You
    are nearest and dearest and all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all time. Think,
    dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from
    falling into the hands of the enemy. Their hands did not falter any the more because those that they loved implored
    them to slay them. It is men&rsquo;s duty towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! And oh, my dear, if
    it is to be that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at the hand of him that loves me best. Dr. Van Helsing, I
    have not forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy&rsquo;s case to him who loved&rdquo;&mdash;she stopped with a flying blush, and
    changed her phrase&mdash;&ldquo;to him who had best right to give her peace. If that time shall come again, I look to you
    to make it a happy memory of my husband&rsquo;s life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the awful thrall
    upon me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Again I swear!&rdquo; came the Professor&rsquo;s resonant voice. Mrs. Harker smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of
    relief she leaned back and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget: this time, if it ever come, may come quickly
    and unexpectedly, and in such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity. At such a time I myself might
    be&mdash;nay! if the time ever comes, <em>shall be</em>&mdash;leagued with your enemy against you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;One more request;&rdquo; she became very solemn as she said this, &ldquo;it is not vital and necessary like the other, but I
    want you to do one thing for me, if you will.&rdquo; We all acquiesced, but no one spoke; there was no need to
    speak:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I want you to read the Burial Service.&rdquo; She was interrupted by a deep groan from her husband; taking his hand in
    hers, she held it over her heart, and continued: &ldquo;You must read it over me some
    day. Whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be a sweet thought to all or some of us.
    You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever&mdash;come what
    may!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But oh, my dear one,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;death is afar off from you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she said, holding up a warning hand. &ldquo;I am deeper in death at this moment than if the weight of an earthly
    grave lay heavy upon me!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, my wife, must I read it?&rdquo; he said, before he began.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It would comfort me, my husband!&rdquo; was all she said; and he began to read when she had got the book ready.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How can I&mdash;how could any one&mdash;tell of that strange scene, its solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its
    horror; and, withal, its sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything
    holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends
    kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of her husband&rsquo;s voice, as in tones so
    broken with emotion that often he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial of the
    Dead. I&mdash;I cannot go on&mdash;words&mdash;and&mdash;v-voice&mdash;f-fail m-me!&rdquo;</p>

    
    <p>She was right in her instinct. Strange as it all was, bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to us who felt its
    potent influence at the time, it comforted us much; and the silence, which showed Mrs. Harker&rsquo;s coming relapse from
    her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any of us as we had dreaded.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Jonathan Harker&rsquo;s Journal.</em></p>

    <p><em>15 October, Varna.</em>&mdash;We left Charing Cross on the morning of the 12th, got to Paris the same night,
    and took the places secured for us in the Orient Express. We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five
    o&rsquo;clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came
    on to this hotel&mdash;&ldquo;the Odessus.&rdquo; The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager to get on, to
    care for them. Until the <em>Czarina Catherine</em> comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything in
    the wide world. Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is coming back. She sleeps a
    great deal; throughout the journey she slept nearly all the time. Before
    sunrise and sunset, however, she is very wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotise
    her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at
    once, as if by habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at these particular moments to
    simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He always asks her what she can see and hear. She answers to the
    first:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Nothing; all is dark.&rdquo; And to the second:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing by. Canvas and cordage strain and masts and
    yards creak. The wind is high&mdash;I can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.&rdquo; It is evident
    that the <em>Czarina Catherine</em> is still at sea, hastening on her way to Varna. Lord Godalming has just returned.
    He had four telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect: that the <em>Czarina Catherine</em>
    had not been reported to Lloyd&rsquo;s from anywhere. He had arranged before leaving London that his agent should send him
    every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported. He was to have a message even if she were not reported,
    so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire.</p>
