    <p>Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I came to them and quieted them. When they
    did feel my hands on them, they whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time. Many times
    through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time
    my coming was with quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was about stepping forth to
    replenish it, for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of
    some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape
    as of women with trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered, as if
    in terror of the worst. I began to fear&mdash;horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that ring
    wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I
    have gone through, and all the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan&rsquo;s horrid experience
    were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a
    shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned
    in terror as men do in pain. Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I feared for
    my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and
    smiled at me; when I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held me back, and whispered,
    like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!&rdquo; I turned to her, and looking in her eyes, said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But you? It is for you that I fear!&rdquo; whereat she laughed&mdash;a laugh, low and unreal, and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Fear for <em>me</em>! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them than I am,&rdquo; and as I wondered at the
    meaning of her words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead. Then, alas! I
    knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever
    without the Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till&mdash;if God have
    not take away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes&mdash;there were before me in actual flesh the same three
    women that Jonathan saw in the room, when they would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the
    bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous lips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina;
    and as their laugh came through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to her, and said in
    those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!&rdquo; In fear I turned to my poor Madam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt
    like flame; for oh! the terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my heart that was all
    of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out
    some of the Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and laughed their low horrid laugh.
    I fed the fire, and feared them not; for I knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not approach,
    me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within the ring, which she could not leave no more than they
    could enter. The horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on them softly, and they grew
    whiter. I knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of terror.</p>

    <p>And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the snow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full
    of woe and terror; but when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again. At the first coming
    of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away
    towards the castle, and were lost.</p>

    <p>Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep
    and sudden sleep, from which I could not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made no response,
    none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead.
    To-day I have much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there may be places where I must go,
    where that sunlight, though snow and mist obscure it, will be to me a safety.</p>

    <p>I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible work. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be
    thanked! she is calm in her sleep....</p>

    <p><em>4 November, evening.</em>&mdash;The accident to the launch has been a terrible thing for us. Only for it we
    should have overtaken the boat long ago; and by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her, off
    on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we follow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is
    getting ready. We have our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if only Morris and Seward were
    with us. We must only hope! If I write no more Good-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>5 November.</em>&mdash;With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing away from the river with their
    leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in a cluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly and
    there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own feelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear
    the howling of wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are dangers to all of us, and from
    all sides. The horses are nearly ready, and we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who, or
    where, or what, or when, or how it may be....</p>

    <p><em>5 November, afternoon.</em>&mdash;I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy at all events, though the
    proving it has been dreadful. When I left Madam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.
    The blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was useful; though the doors were all open I broke
    them off the rusty hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that being entered I might not
    get out. Jonathan&rsquo;s bitter experience served me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I
    knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume, which at times
    made me dizzy. Either there was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves. Then I bethought me of
    my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight. The dilemma had me between his horns.</p>
