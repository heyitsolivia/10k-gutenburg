    <p>&ldquo;I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?&rdquo; asked Quincey. &ldquo;Great Scott! Is this a game?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What is that which you are using?&rdquo; This time the question was by Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat
    as he answered:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence.&rdquo; It was an answer that appalled the most sceptical
    of us, and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor&rsquo;s, a purpose which
    could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the
    places assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any one approaching. I pitied the others,
    especially Arthur. I had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I, who had up
    to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did
    cypress, or yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree or grass wave or rustle so
    ominously; never did bough creak so mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a woeful
    presage through the night.</p>

    <p>There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the Professor a keen &ldquo;S-s-s-s!&rdquo; He pointed;
    and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance&mdash;a dim white figure, which held something dark at
    its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and
    showed in startling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave. We could not see the
    face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry,
    such as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We were starting forward, but the
    Professor&rsquo;s warning hand, seen by us as he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the white
    figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own
    heart grew cold as ice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was turned to adamantine,
    heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture,
    we all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and
    drew the slide; by the concentrated light that fell on Lucy&rsquo;s face we could see that the lips were crimson with
    fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.</p>

    <p>We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even Van Helsing&rsquo;s iron nerve had failed.
    Arthur was next to me, and if I had not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.</p>

    <p>When Lucy&mdash;I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her shape&mdash;saw us she drew back
    with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy&rsquo;s eyes in form and
    colour; but Lucy&rsquo;s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the
    remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have done it with savage
    delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh,
    God, how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to the ground, callous as a devil, the
    child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls over a bone. The
    child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from
    Arthur; when she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his
    hands.</p>

    <p>She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace, said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are hungry for you. Come, and we can rest
    together. Come, my husband, come!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There was something diabolically sweet in her tones&mdash;something of the tingling of glass when
    struck&mdash;which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he
    seemed under a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She was leaping for them, when Van
    Helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a suddenly
    distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter the tomb.</p>

    <p>When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if arrested by some irresistible force. Then she
    turned, and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no quiver from Van
    Helsing&rsquo;s iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen
    again by mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hell-fire, the brows
    were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa&rsquo;s snakes, and the lovely, blood-stained
    mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant
    death&mdash;if looks could kill&mdash;we saw it at that moment.</p>

    <p>And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred
    closing of her means of entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he answered:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like this ever any more;&rdquo; and he groaned in
    spirit. Quincey and I simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the click of the closing
    lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred
    emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman,
    with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice where scarce a knife-blade
    could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty
    to the edges of the door.</p>
