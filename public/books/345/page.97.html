    <p>The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see. On the bed
    beside the window lay Jonathan Harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor. Kneeling on the
    near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad figure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad
    in black. His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised the Count&mdash;in every way, even
    to the scar on his forehead. With his left hand he held both Mrs. Harker&rsquo;s hands, keeping them away with her arms at
    full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck, forcing her face down on his bosom. Her white
    nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man&rsquo;s bare breast which was shown by his
    torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten&rsquo;s nose into a saucer
    of milk to compel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his face, and the hellish look that I had
    heard described seemed to leap into it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils of the white
    aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the
    blood-dripping mouth, champed together like those of a wild beast. With a
    wrench, which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned and sprang at us. But by
    this time the Professor had gained his feet, and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred
    Wafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside the tomb, and cowered back. Further and
    further back he cowered, as we, lifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black
    cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up under Quincey&rsquo;s match, we saw nothing but a faint
    vapour. This, as we looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting open, had swung back to
    its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved forward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and
    with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my
    ears till my dying day. For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was ghastly, with
    a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a
    thin stream of blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore
    on their whiteness the red mark of the Count&rsquo;s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which
    made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew
    the coverlet gently over her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant despairingly, ran out of the
    room. Van Helsing whispered to me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a
    few moments till she recovers herself; I must wake him!&rdquo; He dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it
    began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that
    was heart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the window. There was much moonshine; and as I
    looked I could see Quincey Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yew-tree. It puzzled
    me to think why he was doing this; but at the instant I heard Harker&rsquo;s quick exclamation as he woke to partial
    consciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well be, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed
    dazed for a few seconds, and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he started up. His
    wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him with her arms
    stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly, however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows
    together, held her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name what does this mean?&rdquo; Harker cried out. &ldquo;Dr. Seward, Dr. Van Helsing, what is it? What has
    happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear, what is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to this!&rdquo;
    and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly together. &ldquo;Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!&rdquo;
    With a quick movement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,&mdash;all the man in him awake at the
    need for instant exertion. &ldquo;What has happened? Tell me all about it!&rdquo; he cried without pausing. &ldquo;Dr. Van Helsing,
    you love Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too far yet. Guard her while I look for
    <em>him</em>!&rdquo; His wife, through her terror and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly forgetting
    her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough to-night, God knows, without the dread of his
    harming you. You must stay with me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!&rdquo; Her expression became frantic
    as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.</p>

    <p>Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his little golden crucifix, and said with
    wonderful calmness:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach. You are safe for
    to-night; and we must be calm and take counsel together.&rdquo; She shuddered and was silent, holding down her head on her
    husband&rsquo;s breast. When she raised it, his white night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and
    where the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she saw it she drew back, with a low wail,
    and whispered, amidst choking sobs:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it should be that it is I who am now his worst
    enemy, and whom he may have most cause to fear.&rdquo; To this he spoke out resolutely:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not hear it of you; and I shall not hear it
    from you. May God judge me by my deserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour, if by any
    act or will of mine anything ever come between us!&rdquo; He put out his arms and folded her<a name="page_265"
    id="page_265"></a> to his breast; and for a while she lay there sobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with
    eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a while her sobs became
    less frequent and more faint, and then he said to me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his
    nervous power to the utmost:&mdash;</p>
