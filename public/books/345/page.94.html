    <p>His is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Letter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming.</em></p>

    <p class="r"><em>&ldquo;1 October.</em></p>

    <p class="nind">&ldquo;My Lord,</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with regard to the desire of your Lordship,
    expressed by Mr. Harker on your behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and purchase of No.
    347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors of the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is
    a foreign nobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the purchase money in notes â€˜over the
    counter,&rsquo; if your Lordship will pardon us using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever of
    him.</p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;We are, my Lord,&ldquo;Your Lordship&rsquo;s humble servants,&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mitchell, Sons &amp;
    Candy</span>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>2 October.</em>&mdash;I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to make an accurate note of any
    sound he might hear from Renfield&rsquo;s room, and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he was
    to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire in the
    study&mdash;Mrs. Harker having gone to bed&mdash;we discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day. Harker was
    the only one who had any result, and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.</p>

    <p>Before going to bed I went round to the patient&rsquo;s room and looked in through the observation trap. He was
    sleeping soundly, and his heart rose and fell with regular respiration.</p>

    <p>This morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight he was restless and kept saying his
    prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him if that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was something about
    his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if he had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having
    &ldquo;dozed&rdquo; for a while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are watched.</p>

    <p>To-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are looking after horses. Godalming thinks that
    it will be well to have horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we seek there will be no
    time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at
    his weakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the British Museum looking up some authorities on
    ancient medicine. The old physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept, and the Professor
    is searching for witch and demon cures which may be useful to us later.</p>

    <p>I sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in strait-waistcoats.</p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and our work of to-morrow may be the
    beginning of the end. I wonder if Renfield&rsquo;s quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have so followed the
    doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the monster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we
    could only get some hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument with him to-day and his
    resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a valuable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is
    he?&mdash;&mdash; That wild yell seemed to come from his room....</p>

    
    <p>The attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had somehow met with some accident. He had
    heard him yell; and when he went to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood. I must go
    at once....</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI<small>DR. SEWARD&rsquo;S DIARY</small></h2>
    <p><em>3 October.</em>&mdash;Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well as I can remember it, since
    last I made an entry. Not a detail that I can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.</p>

    <p>When I came to Renfield&rsquo;s room I found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood.
    When I went to move him, it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries; there seemed none
    of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I
    could see that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the floor&mdash;indeed it was from the
    face wounds that the pool of blood originated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we
    turned him over:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed.&rdquo;
    How such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite bewildered, and his brows
    were gathered in as he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor. I saw
    a young woman do it once at the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he might have
    broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward kink. But for the life of me I can&rsquo;t imagine how the
    two things occurred. If his back was broke, he couldn&rsquo;t beat his head; and if his face was like that before the fall
    out of bed, there would be marks of it.&rdquo; I said to him:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want him without an instant&rsquo;s delay.&rdquo; The man
    ran off, and within a few minutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When he saw Renfield
    on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and then turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes,
    for he said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much attention.
    I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself. If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join
    you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury. Van
    Helsing returned with extraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had evidently been thinking and
    had his mind made up; for, almost before he looked at the patient, he whispered to me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes conscious, after the operation.&rdquo; So I
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at present. You had better go your round, and
    Dr. Van Helsing will operate. Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
