    <p>&ldquo;But, Count,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you know and speak English thoroughly!&rdquo; He bowed gravely.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I fear that I am but a little way on the
    road I would travel. True, I know the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you speak excellently.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your London, none there are who would not know
    me for a stranger. That is not enough for me. Here I am noble; I am <em>boyar</em>; the common people know me, and I
    am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men know him not&mdash;and to know not is to care not
    for. I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his speaking if he hear my
    words, â€˜Ha, ha! a stranger!&rsquo; I have been so long master that I would be master still&mdash;or at least that none
    other should be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me
    all about my new estate in London. You shall, I trust, rest here with me
    awhile, so that by our talking I may learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make error,
    even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive
    one who has so many important affairs in hand.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Of course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might come into that room when I chose. He
    answered: &ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; and added:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are locked, where of course you will not wish
    to go. There is reason that all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge, you
    would perhaps better understand.&rdquo; I said I was sure of this, and then he went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you
    many strange things. Nay, from what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of what strange
    things there may be.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to talk, if only for talking&rsquo;s sake, I asked
    him many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come within my notice. Sometimes he sheered
    off the subject, or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked
    most frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked him of some of the strange things of the
    preceding night, as, for instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames. He then
    explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year&mdash;last night, in fact, when
    all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway&mdash;a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has
    been concealed. &ldquo;That treasure has been hidden,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;in the region through which you came last night, there
    can be but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk.
    Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or
    invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the
    patriots went out to meet them&mdash;men and women, the aged and the children too&mdash;and waited their coming on
    the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on them with
    their artificial avalanches. When the invader was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been
    sheltered in the friendly soil.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But how,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;can it have remained so long undiscovered, when there is a sure index to it if men will but
    take the trouble to look?&rdquo; The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long, sharp, canine teeth
    showed out strangely; he answered:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only appear on one night; and on that night
    no man of this land will, if he can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he would not know
    what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look
    in daylight even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to find these places again?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There you are right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I know no more than the dead where even to look for them.&rdquo; Then we drifted into
    other matters.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;tell me of London and of the house which you have procured for me.&rdquo; With an apology for
    my remissness, I went into my own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a
    rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and
    the lamp lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit in the study or library, and I
    found the Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw&rsquo;s Guide. When I came in
    he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts.
    He was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings. He clearly
    had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very
    much more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there I shall be all alone, and my friend
    Harker Jonathan&mdash;nay, pardon me, I fall into my country&rsquo;s habit of putting your patronymic first&mdash;my
    friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be in Exeter, miles away, probably
    working at papers of the law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins. So!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>We went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at
    Purfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers, and had written a letter with
    them ready to post to Mr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a place. I read to him the
    notes which I had made at the time, and which I inscribe here:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to be required, and where was displayed a
    dilapidated notice that the place was for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure, built of
    heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of years. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron,
    all eaten with rust.</p>
