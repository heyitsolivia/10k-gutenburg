    <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, &ldquo;all that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer, and the
    belief of your policemen as to whether or no that employer has a good
    conscience or a bad one. Your police must indeed be zealous men and clever&mdash;oh, so clever!&mdash;in reading the
    heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred
    empty house in this your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such things are rightly done, and
    at the time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine
    house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up his house, some burglar came and
    broke window at back and got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the
    door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big
    notice; and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them. Then
    he go to a builder, and he sell him that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a
    certain time. And your police and other authority help him all they can. And when that owner come back from his
    holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done <em>en règle</em>; and
    in our work we shall be <em>en règle</em> too. We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to
    think of, shall deem it strange; but we shall go after ten o&rsquo;clock, when there are many about, and such things would
    be done were we indeed owners of the house.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of Mina&rsquo;s face became relaxed a thought; there was
    hope in such good counsel. Van Helsing went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;When once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of us can remain there whilst the rest find
    the other places where there be more earth-boxes&mdash;at Bermondsey and Mile End.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Lord Godalming stood up. &ldquo;I can be of some use here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall wire to my people to have horses and
    carriages where they will be most convenient.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Look here, old fellow,&rdquo; said Morris, &ldquo;it is a capital idea to have all ready in case we want to go horsebacking;
    but don&rsquo;t you think that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of Walworth or Mile
    End would attract too much attention for our purposes? It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or
    east; and even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Friend Quincey is right!&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;His head is what you call in
    plane with the horizon. It is a difficult thing that we go to do, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it
    may.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mina took a growing interest in everything and I was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping her
    to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night. She was very, very pale&mdash;almost ghastly, and so thin
    that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence. I did not mention this last, lest it
    should give her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor
    Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood. As yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet
    was short, and there was time for fear.</p>

    <p>When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the disposition of our forces, there were
    new sources of doubt. It was finally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the Count&rsquo;s lair
    close at hand. In case he should find it out too soon, we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of
    destruction; and his presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us some new clue.</p>

    <p>As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that, after our visit to Carfax, we should all
    enter the house in Piccadilly; that the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming and Quincey
    found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed them. It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged,
    that the Count might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and
    there. At any rate, we might be able to follow him in force. To this plan I strenuously objected, and so far as my
    going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay and protect Mina, I thought that my mind was made up on the
    subject; but Mina would not listen to my objection. She said that there might be some law matter in which I could be
    useful; that amongst the Count&rsquo;s papers might be some clue which I could understand out of my experience in
    Transylvania; and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the Count&rsquo;s
    extraordinary power. I had to give in, for Mina&rsquo;s resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for
    <em>her</em> that we should all work together. &ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have no fear. Things have been as bad as they
    can be; and whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort. Go, my husband! God can, if He
    wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any one present.&rdquo; So I started up crying out: &ldquo;Then in God&rsquo;s name let us come at once, for we are losing time. The Count may come to
    Piccadilly earlier than we think.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Not so!&rdquo; said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Do you forget,&rdquo; he said, with actually a smile, &ldquo;that last night he banqueted heavily, and will sleep
    late?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Did I forget! shall I ever&mdash;can I ever! Can any of us ever forget that terrible scene! Mina struggled hard
    to keep her brave countenance; but the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and shuddered
    whilst she moaned. Van Helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience. He had simply lost sight of her
    and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort. When it struck him what he said, he was horrified at his
    thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. &ldquo;Oh, Madam Mina,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;dear, dear Madam Mina, alas! that I of all who
    so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do
    not deserve so; but you will forget it, will you not?&rdquo; He bent low beside her as he spoke; she took his hand, and
    looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:&mdash;</p>
