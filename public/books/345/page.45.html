    <p>Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and strong, though not nearly so much so as
    the day before. When Van Helsing had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict injunctions
    that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest
    telegraph office.</p>

    <p>Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened. I tried to keep her amused
    and interested. When her mother came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but said to me
    gratefully:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We owe you so much, Dr. Seward, for all you have done, but you really must now take care not to overwork
    yourself. You are looking pale yourself. You want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit; that you do!&rdquo; As she
    spoke, Lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily, for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such
    an unwonted drain to the head. The reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me. I smiled
    and nodded, and laid my finger on my lips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.</p>

    <p>Van Helsing returned in a couple of hours, and presently said to me: &ldquo;Now you go home, and eat much and drink
    enough. Make yourself strong. I stay here to-night, and I shall sit up with little miss myself. You and I must watch
    the case, and we must have none other to know. I have grave reasons. No, do not ask them; think what you will. Do
    not fear to think even the most not-probable. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of them might not sit up with Miss Lucy.
    They implored me to let them; and when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing&rsquo;s wish that either he or I should sit up, they
    asked me quite piteously to intercede with the &ldquo;foreign gentleman.&rdquo; I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it
    is because I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy&rsquo;s account, that their devotion was manifested;
    for over and over again have I seen similar instances of woman&rsquo;s kindness. I got back here in time for a late
    dinner; went my rounds&mdash;all well; and set this down whilst waiting for sleep. It is coming.<a name="page_122"

    <p><em>11 September.</em>&mdash;This afternoon I went over to Hillingham. Found Van Helsing in excellent spirits, and
    Lucy much better. Shortly after I had arrived, a big parcel from abroad came for the Professor. He opened it with
    much impressment&mdash;assumed, of course&mdash;and showed a great bundle of white flowers.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;These are for you, Miss Lucy,&rdquo; he said.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;For me? Oh, Dr. Van Helsing!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. These are medicines.&rdquo; Here Lucy made a wry face. &ldquo;Nay, but they are
    not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall point out to
    my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort. Aha, my
    pretty miss, that bring the so nice nose all straight again. This is medicinal, but you do not know how. I put him
    in your window, I make pretty wreath, and hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. Oh yes! they, like the
    lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. It smell so like the waters of Lethe, and of that fountain of youth that
    the Conquistadores sought for in the Floridas, and find him all too late.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Whilst he was speaking, Lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them. Now she threw them down, saying,
    with half-laughter, and half-disgust:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me. Why, these flowers are only common garlic.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>To my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows
    meeting:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No trifling with me! I never jest! There is grim purpose in all I do; and I warn you that you do not thwart me.
    Take care, for the sake of others if not for your own.&rdquo; Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might well be, he went
    on more gently: &ldquo;Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you
    in those so common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the wreath that you are to wear.
    But hush! no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;
    and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with
    me, friend John, and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem, where my
    friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year. I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have
    been here.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>We went into the room, taking the flowers with us. The Professor&rsquo;s actions
    were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopœia that I ever heard of. First he fastened up the windows
    and latched them securely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over the sashes, as though to
    ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell. Then with the wisp he rubbed
    all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round the fireplace in the same way. It all
    seemed grotesque to me, and presently I said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, Professor, I know you always have a reason for what you do, but this certainly puzzles me. It is well we
    have no sceptic here, or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am!&rdquo; he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which Lucy was to wear round her neck.</p>

    <p>We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the
    wreath of garlic round her neck. The last words he said to her were:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do not to-night open the window or the
    door.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; said Lucy, &ldquo;and thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me! Oh, what have I done to
    be blessed with such friends?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want&mdash;two nights of travel, much reading in the day between, and
    much anxiety on the day to follow, and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in the morning early you call
    for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much more strong for my ‘spell&rsquo; which I have work. Ho!
    ho!&rdquo;</p>
