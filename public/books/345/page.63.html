    <p>&ldquo;Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be good, but I had yet to
    learn&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He finished his speech with a courtly bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me
    about, so he at once began:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin to inquire somewhere, and there was none
    to ask. I know that you were with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary&mdash;you need not look surprised, Madam
    Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in imitation of you&mdash;and in that diary she traces by inference
    certain things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In great perplexity then I come to you,
    and ask you out of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always so with young ladies.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you if you like.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.&rdquo; I could not resist the temptation of mystifying
    him a bit&mdash;I suppose it is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouths&mdash;so I
    handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful bow, and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;May I read it?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If you wish,&rdquo; I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for an instant his face fell. Then he stood
    up and bowed.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, you so clever woman!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a man of much thankfulness; but see, his
    wife have all the good things. And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me? Alas! I know
    not the shorthand.&rdquo; By this time my little joke was over, and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy
    from my workbasket and handed it to him.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;I could not help it; but I had been thinking that it was of dear Lucy that you wished to
    ask, and so that you might not have time to wait&mdash;not on my account, but because I know your time must be
    precious&mdash;I have written it out on the typewriter for you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He took it and his eyes glistened. &ldquo;You are so good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And may I read it now? I may want to ask you some
    things when I have read.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat.&rdquo; He
    bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers, whilst I went to
    see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up
    and down the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and took me by both hands.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, Madam Mina,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how can I say what I owe to you? This paper is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me.
    I am daze, I am dazzle, with so much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that you do not,
    cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so clever woman. Madam&rdquo;&mdash;he said this very
    solemnly&mdash;&ldquo;if ever Abraham Van Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know. It will
    be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a friend, but all I
    have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there
    are lights; you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and your husband will be blessed in
    you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But, doctor, you praise me too much, and&mdash;and you do not know me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Not know you&mdash;I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and women; I, who have made my specialty
    the brain and all that belongs to him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you have so
    goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every line. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor
    Lucy of your marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell all their lives, and by day and
    by hour and by minute, such things that angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of angels&rsquo;
    eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean
    nature. And your husband&mdash;tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and is he strong and
    hearty?&rdquo; I saw here an opening to ask him about Jonathan, so I said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins&rsquo;s death.&rdquo; He interrupted:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters.&rdquo; I went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he had a sort of shock.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of a shock was it?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something which led to his brain fever.&rdquo; And here
    the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he experienced, the whole
    fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I
    suppose I was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to him, and implored him to make my
    husband well again. He took my hands and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my hand
    in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not had much time for friendships; but since
    I have been summoned to here by my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such nobility that I
    feel more than ever&mdash;and it has grown with my advancing years&mdash;the
    loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here full of respect for you, and you have given me
    hope&mdash;hope, not in what I am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life happy&mdash;good
    women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I
    may here be of some use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my study and experience. I
    promise you that I will gladly do <em>all</em> for him that I can&mdash;all to make his life strong and manly, and
    your life a happy one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious. Husband Jonathan would not
    like to see you so pale; and what he like not where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat
    and smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in
    Exeter to-night, for I want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I will ask you
    questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of husband Jonathan&rsquo;s trouble so far as you can, but not yet.
    You must eat now; afterwards you shall tell me all.&rdquo;</p>
