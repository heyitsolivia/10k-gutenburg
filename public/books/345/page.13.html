    <p>What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man? I feel the dread of this
    horrible place overpowering me; I am in fear&mdash;in awful fear&mdash;and there is no escape for me; I am
    encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....</p>

    
    <p><em>15 May.</em>&mdash;Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion. He moved downwards in a
    sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good deal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his
    head had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without avail&mdash;the distance was too great to allow
    a proper angle of sight. I knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than
    I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as
    I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the stone stairs to the hall where I had
    entered originally. I found I could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the door was
    locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count&rsquo;s room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so
    that I may get it and escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages, and to
    try the doors that opened from them. One or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in
    them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last, however, I found one door at the top of the
    stairway which, though it seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder, and found that it
    was not really locked, but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy
    door rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have again, so I exerted myself, and with many
    efforts forced it back so that I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms
    I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the
    castle, the windows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter side, as well as to the former,
    there was a great precipice. The castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was quite
    impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently
    light and comfort, impossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the west was a great valley,
    and then, rising far away, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on
    peak, the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of
    the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had
    more air of comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through
    the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and
    disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant
    moonlight, but I was glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart
    and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the
    presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I found a soft quietude come over me. Here I
    am, sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much thought and many
    blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it
    last. It is nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my senses deceive me, the old centuries
    had, and have, powers of their own which mere &ldquo;modernity&rdquo; cannot kill.</p>

    
    <p><em>Later: the Morning of 16 May.</em>&mdash;God preserve my sanity, for to this I am reduced. Safety and the
    assurance of safety are things of the past. Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not
    go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul
    things that lurk in this hateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I can look for
    safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his purpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of
    that way lies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me. Up to now I never
    quite knew what Shakespeare meant when he made Hamlet say:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza"><span class="i0">&ldquo;My tablets! quick, my tablets!</span><span class="i0">&rsquo;Tis meet that I put
      it down,&rdquo; etc.,</span></div>
    </div>
    <p class="nind">for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in
    its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose. The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.</p>

    <p>The Count&rsquo;s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens me
    more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon me. I shall fear to doubt what he may
    say!</p>

    <p>When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The
    Count&rsquo;s warning came into my mind, but I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me, and with
    it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a
    sense of freedom which refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep
    here, where, of old, ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their
    menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I
    lay, I could look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself
    for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly
    real&mdash;so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least believe
    that it was all sleep.</p>
