    <p>&ldquo;No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any
    sitting up, it is I who will sit up with you.&rdquo; I would not argue the point, but went and had my supper. Lucy came
    with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, I made an excellent meal, and had a couple of glasses of the more
    than excellent port. Then Lucy took me upstairs, and showed me a room next her own, where a cozy fire was burning.
    &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must stay here. I shall leave this door open and my door too. You can lie on the sofa for I
    know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon. If I
    want anything I shall call out, and you can come to me at once.&rdquo; I could not but acquiesce, for I was &ldquo;dog-tired,&rdquo;
    and could not have sat up had I tried. So, on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything, I lay
    on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Lucy Westenra&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>9 September.</em>&mdash;I feel so happy to-night. I have been so miserably weak, that to be able to think and
    move about is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a
    steel sky. Somehow Arthur feels very, very close to me. I seem to feel his presence warm about me. I suppose it is
    that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and
    strength give Love rein, and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills. I know where my thoughts are. If
    Arthur only knew! My dear, my dear, your ears must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. Oh, the blissful rest of
    last night! How I slept, with that dear, good Dr. Seward watching me. And to-night I shall not fear to sleep, since
    he is close at hand and within call. Thank everybody for being so good to me! Thank God! Good-night, Arthur.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>10 September.</em>&mdash;I was conscious of the Professor&rsquo;s hand on my head, and started awake all in a second.
    That is one of the things that we learn in an asylum, at any rate.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And how is our patient?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Come, let us see,&rdquo; he said. And together we went into the room.</p>

    <p>The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like
    tread, over to the bed.</p>

    <p>As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I heard the Professor&rsquo;s low hiss of
    inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and his
    exclamation of horror, &ldquo;Gott in Himmel!&rdquo; needed no enforcement from his agonised face. He raised his hand and
    pointed to the bed, and his iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees begin to tremble.</p>

    <p>There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly white and wan-looking than ever. Even the
    lips were white, and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a corpse after a
    prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long
    years of habit stood to him, and he put it down again softly. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bring the brandy.&rdquo; I flew to the
    dining-room, and returned with the decanter. He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and
    wrist and heart. He felt her heart, and after a few moments of agonising suspense said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It is not too late. It beats, though but feebly. All our work is undone; we
    must begin again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have to call on you yourself this time, friend John.&rdquo; As he
    spoke, he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I had taken off my coat and rolled
    up my shirt-sleeve. There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so, without a
    moment&rsquo;s delay, we began the operation. After a time&mdash;it did not seem a short time either, for the draining
    away of one&rsquo;s blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling&mdash;Van Helsing held up a warning
    finger. &ldquo;Do not stir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I fear that with growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh,
    so much danger. But I shall precaution take. I shall give hypodermic injection of morphia.&rdquo; He proceeded then,
    swiftly and deftly, to carry out his intent. The effect on Lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge subtly
    into the narcotic sleep. It was with a feeling of personal pride that I could see a faint tinge of colour steal back
    into the pallid cheeks and lips. No man knows, till he experiences it, what it is to feel his own life-blood drawn
    away into the veins of the woman he loves.</p>

    <p>The Professor watched me critically. &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Already?&rdquo; I remonstrated. &ldquo;You took a great deal
    more from Art.&rdquo; To which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He is her lover, her <em>fianc√©</em>. You have work, much work, to do for her and for others; and the present will
    suffice.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When we stopped the operation, he attended to Lucy, whilst I applied digital pressure to my own incision. I laid
    down, whilst I waited his leisure to attend to me, for I felt faint and a little sick. By-and-by he bound up my
    wound, and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself. As I was leaving the room, he came after me, and
    half whispered:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Mind, nothing must be said of this. If our young lover should turn up unexpected, as before, no word to him. It
    would at once frighten him and enjealous him, too. There must be none. So!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When I came back he looked at me carefully, and then said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You are not much the worse. Go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and rest awhile; then have much breakfast,
    and come here to me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I followed out his orders, for I knew how right and wise they were. I had done my part, and now my next duty was
    to keep up my strength. I felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred.
    I fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over and over again how Lucy had
    made such a retrograde movement, and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show
    for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for, sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back
    to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their edges&mdash;tiny though they
    were.</p>
