    <p>&ldquo;I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long this horrible thing lasted I know not; but
    it seemed that a long time must have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I saw it drip with
    the fresh blood!&rdquo; The remembrance seemed for a while to overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but
    for her husband&rsquo;s sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and
    went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Then he spoke to me mockingly, â€˜And so you, like the others, would play your brains against mine. You would help
    these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already, and will know in
    full before long, what it is to cross my path. They should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst
    they played wits against me&mdash;against me who commanded nations, and intrigued for them, and fought for them,
    hundreds of years before they were born&mdash;I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now to
    me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful wine-press for a while; and shall be later on
    my companion and my helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall minister to your needs. But
    as yet you are to be punished for what you have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my call.
    When my brain says &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; to you, you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding; and to that end this!&rsquo; With that he
    pulled open his shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When the blood began to spurt out,
    he took my hands in one of his, holding them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to the
    wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the&mdash;&mdash; Oh my God! my God! what have I done?
    What have I done to deserve such a fate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days. God
    pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril; and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!&rdquo; Then she
    began to rub her lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.</p>

    <p>As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken, and everything became more and more
    clear. Harker was still and quiet; but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look which
    deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh
    stood darkly out against the whitening hair.</p>

    <p>We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy pair till we can meet together and arrange
    about taking action.</p>

    <p>Of this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house in all the great round of its daily course.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII<small>JONATHAN HARKER&rsquo;S JOURNAL</small></h2>
    <p><em>3 October.</em>&mdash;As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It is now six o&rsquo;clock, and we are
    to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed that
    if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God knows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every
    chance, for I dare not stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end the little things may
    teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could not have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day.
    However, we must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears running down her dear cheeks, that it is
    in trouble and trial that our faith is tested&mdash;that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us up to
    the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!</p>

    <p>When Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor Renfield, we went gravely into what was to be
    done. First, Dr. Seward told us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below they had found
    Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were
    broken.</p>

    <p>Dr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything. He said that he had been
    sitting down&mdash;he confessed to half dozing&mdash;when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield had
    called out loudly several times, &ldquo;God! God! God!&rdquo; after that there was a sound of falling, and when he entered the
    room he found him lying on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing asked if he had heard
    &ldquo;voices&rdquo; or &ldquo;a voice,&rdquo; and he said he could not say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as
    there was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear to it, if required, that the word &ldquo;God&rdquo; was
    spoken by the patient. Dr. Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into the matter; the
    question of an inquest had to be considered, and it would never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe
    it. As it was, he thought that on the attendant&rsquo;s evidence he could give a certificate of death by<a name="page_270"
    id="page_270"></a> misadventure in falling from bed. In case the coroner should demand it, there would be a formal
    inquest, necessarily to the same result.</p>

    <p>When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step, the very first thing we decided was
    that Mina should be in full confidence; that nothing of any sort&mdash;no matter how painful&mdash;should be kept
    from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in
    such a depth of despair. &ldquo;There must be no concealment,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Alas! we have had too much already. And besides
    there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than I have already endured&mdash;than I suffer now!
    Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!&rdquo; Van Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she
    spoke, and said, suddenly but quietly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for others from yourself, after what has
    happened?&rdquo; Her face grew set in its lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she
    answered:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ah no! for my mind is made up!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo; he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of
    what she meant. Her answer came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Because if I find in myself&mdash;and I shall watch keenly for it&mdash;a sign of harm to any that I love, I
    shall die!&rdquo;</p>
