    <p>&ldquo;He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call; but he cut her off&mdash;take her, as he
    can do, out of his own power, that so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that<a name="page_318"
    id="page_318"></a> our man-brains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will come
    higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries, that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only
    work selfish and therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance! She know it not; and it
    would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her
    great brain which is trained like man&rsquo;s brain, but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the Count give
    her, and which he may not take away altogether&mdash;though he think not so. Hush! let me speak, and you shall
    learn. Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits. I fear, as I never feared before. We can only trust the good
    God. Silence! here she comes!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics, just as he had when Lucy died, but with
    a great effort he controlled himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into the room, bright
    and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number
    of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face brightening up as he read. Then
    holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Friend John, to you with so much of experience already&mdash;and you, too, dear Madam Mina, that are
    young&mdash;here is a lesson: do not fear ever to think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I
    fear to let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to where that half-thought come from and I
    find that he be no half-thought at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet strong to use
    his little wings. Nay, like the &ldquo;Ugly Duck&rdquo; of my friend Hans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big
    swan-thought that sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. See I read here what Jonathan
    have written:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought his forces over The Great River into Turkey
    Land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody
    field where his troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What does this tell us? Not much? no! The Count&rsquo;s child-thought see nothing; therefore he speak so free. Your
    man-thought see nothing; my man-thought see nothing, till just now. No! But there comes another word from some one
    who speak without though because she, too, know not what it mean&mdash;what it
    <em>might</em> mean. Just as there are elements which rest, yet when in nature&rsquo;s course they move on their way and
    they touch&mdash;then pouf! and there comes a flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some; but
    that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues. Is it not so? Well, I shall explain. To begin, have you ever
    study the philosophy of crime? ‘Yes&rsquo; and ‘No.&rsquo; You, John, yes; for it is a study of insanity. You, no, Madam Mina;
    for crime touch you not&mdash;not but once. Still, your mind works true, and argues not <em>a particulari ad
    universale</em>. There is this peculiarity in criminals. It is so constant, in all countries and at all times, that
    even police, who know not much from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that <em>it is</em>. That is to be
    empiric. The criminal always work at one crime&mdash;that is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and
    who will of none other. This criminal has not full man-brain. He is clever and cunning and resourceful; but he be
    not of man-stature as to brain. He be of child-brain in much. Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime
    also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he have done. The little bird, the little fish,
    the little animal learn not by principle, but empirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to him the ground
    to start from to do more. ‘<em>Dos pou sto</em>,&rsquo; said Archimedes. ‘Give me a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!&rsquo; To
    do once, is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have the purpose to do more, he continue
    to do the same again every time, just as he have done before! Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are opened, and that
    to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,&rdquo; for Mrs. Harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. He
    went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Now you shall speak. Tell us two dry men of science what you see with those so bright eyes.&rdquo; He took her hand
    and held it whilst she spoke. His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and
    unconsciously, as she spoke:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The Count is a criminal and of criminal type. Nordau and Lombroso would so classify him, and <em>quâ</em> criminal
    he is of imperfectly formed mind. Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit. His past is a clue, and
    the one page of it that we know&mdash;and that from his own lips&mdash;tells that once before, when in what Mr.
    Morris would call a ‘tight place,&rsquo; he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade, and thence,
    without losing purpose, prepared himself for a new effort. He came again better equipped for his work; and won. So
    he came to London to invade a new land. He was beaten, and when all hope of
    success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over the sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled
    back over the Danube from Turkey Land.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good, good! oh, you so clever lady!&rdquo; said Van Helsing, enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand. A
    moment later he said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room consultation:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. I have hope.&rdquo; Turning to her again, he said with keen
    expectation:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But go on. Go on! there is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid; John and I know. I do in any case, and shall
    tell you if you are right. Speak, without fear!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Then, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness, he
    confines himself to one purpose. That purpose is remorseless. As he fled back over the Danube, leaving his forces to
    be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being safe, careless of all. So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat
    from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night. I felt it! Oh, I felt it! Thank God, for
    His great mercy! My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me is a fear lest in
    some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his ends.&rdquo; The Professor stood up:&mdash;</p>
