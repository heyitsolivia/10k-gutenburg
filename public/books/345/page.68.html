    <p>I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.</p>

    <p>It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more
    sure than ever of his ground, and so emboldened to proceed in his task. &ldquo;Are you satisfied now, friend John?&rdquo; he
    asked.</p>

    <p>I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as I answered him:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am satisfied that Lucy&rsquo;s body is not in that coffin; but that only proves one thing.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And what is that, friend John?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That it is not there.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That is good logic,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so far as it goes. But how do you&mdash;how can you&mdash;account for it not
    being there?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Perhaps a body-snatcher,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;Some of the undertaker&rsquo;s people may have stolen it.&rdquo; I felt that I was
    speaking folly, and yet it was the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. &ldquo;Ah well!&rdquo; he said,
    &ldquo;we must have more proof. Come with me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag, blew out the light, and
    placed the candle also in the bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and locked it. He
    handed me the key, saying: &ldquo;Will you keep it? You had better be assured.&rdquo; I laughed&mdash;it was not a very cheerful
    laugh, I am bound to say&mdash;as I motioned him to keep it. &ldquo;A key is nothing,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;there may be duplicates;
    and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind.&rdquo; He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he
    told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other. I took up my place behind a
    yew-tree, and I saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight.</p>

    <p>It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant clock strike twelve, and in time came
    one and two. I was chilled and unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand and with
    myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so
    altogether I had a dreary, miserable time.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at
    the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the Professor&rsquo;s side of
    the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs,
    and I stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an early cock crew. A little way off, beyond
    a line of scattered juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim figure flitted in the
    direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I
    heard the rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and coming over, found the Professor
    holding in his arms a tiny child. When he saw me he held it out to me, and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied now?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Do you not see the child?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the
    sleeping child.</p>

    <p>When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of trees, and struck a match, and looked at the
    child&rsquo;s throat. It was without a scratch or scar of any kind.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Was I right?&rdquo; I asked triumphantly.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We were just in time,&rdquo; said the Professor thankfully.</p>

    <p>We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted about it. If we were to take it to a
    police-station we should have to give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should have had
    to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child. So finally we decided that we would take it to the
    Heath, and when we heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find it; we would then seek
    our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out well. At the edge of
    Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman&rsquo;s heavy tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until
    he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation of astonishment, and then we went away
    silently. By good chance we got a cab near the &ldquo;Spaniards,&rdquo; and drove to town.</p>

    <p>I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours&rsquo; sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me
    at noon. He insists that I shall go with him on another expedition.</p>

    
    <p><em>27 September.</em>&mdash;It was two o&rsquo;clock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt. The funeral
    held at noon was all completed, and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away, when,
    looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that
    we were safe till morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at
    most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of
    place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I
    felt it was all so useless. Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead nearly a week were
    really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own
    eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however, and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way
    of going on his own road, no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again courteously
    motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the
    sunshine streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy&rsquo;s coffin, and I followed. He bent over and again forced back
    the leaden flange; and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me.</p>

    <p>There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral. She was, if possible, more
    radiantly beautiful than ever; and I could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than before;
    and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Is this a juggle?&rdquo; I said to him.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Are you convinced now?&rdquo; said the Professor in response, and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that
    made me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth.</p>
