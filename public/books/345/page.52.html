    <p>&ldquo;I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act properly and wisely, there may be an inquest,
    and that paper would have to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we had it would surely
    kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs.
    Westenra had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us fill up the certificate at once,
    and I shall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be sad in the foes that beset her, is at least
    happy in the friends that love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old man. Ah yes, I
    know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the more for it! Now go.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him that Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy
    also had been ill, but was now going on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him where I was
    going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to ourselves?&rdquo;
    I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker
    to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.</p>

    <p>When I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him as soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up
    to her room. She was still sleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side. From his
    putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling
    nature. So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where the blinds were not drawn down, and
    which was a little more cheerful, or rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said to
    me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Jack Seward, I don&rsquo;t want to shove myself in anywhere where I&rsquo;ve no right to be; but this is no ordinary case.
    You know I loved that girl and wanted to marry her; but, although that&rsquo;s all past and gone, I can&rsquo;t help feeling
    anxious about her all the same. What is it that&rsquo;s wrong with her? The Dutchman&mdash;and a fine old fellow he is; I
    can see that&mdash;said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have <em>another</em> transfusion of
    blood, and that both you and he were exhausted. Now I know well that you medical men speak <em>in camera</em>, and
    that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is no common matter, and, whatever
    it is, I have done my part. Is not that so?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; I said, and he went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did to-day. Is not that so?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer. I have not
    seen anything pulled down so quick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a
    night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night, and what with his gorge and the
    vein left open, there wasn&rsquo;t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a bullet through her as she
    lay. Jack, if you may tell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?&rdquo; As he spoke the
    poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter
    ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very heart was bleeding,
    and it took all the manhood of him&mdash;and there was a royal lot of it,
    too&mdash;to keep him from breaking down. I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything
    which the Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no
    reason for not answering, so I answered in the same phrase: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And how long has this been going on?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;About ten days.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins
    within that time the blood of four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn&rsquo;t hold it.&rdquo; Then, coming close to
    me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: &ldquo;What took it out?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I shook my head. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is the crux. Van Helsing is simply frantic about it, and I am at my wits&rsquo; end.
    I can&rsquo;t even hazard a guess. There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our
    calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall not occur again. Here we stay until all be
    well&mdash;or ill.&rdquo; Quincey held out his hand. &ldquo;Count me in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You and the Dutchman will tell me what to
    do, and I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy&rsquo;s first movement was to feel in her breast, and, to my surprise,
    produced the paper which Van Helsing had given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had come
    from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she
    looked around the room, and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her poor thin hands before
    her pale face. We both understood what that meant&mdash;that she had realised to the full her mother&rsquo;s death; so we
    tried what we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but she was very low in thought and
    spirit, and wept silently and weakly for a long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with
    her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell into a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred.
    Whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped over and took the
    pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in
    her hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments. Van Helsing seemed
    surprised, and his brows gathered as if in thought, but he said nothing.</p>

    
    <p><em>19 September.</em>&mdash;All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid to sleep, and something weaker
    when she woke from it. The Professor and I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment unattended.
    Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew that all night long he patrolled round and round the
    house.</p>
