    <p>The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and there was no need for tears in his eyes.
    He said to me: &ldquo;Remain till I return,&rdquo; and left the room. He came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box
    waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed.
    Then he took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and placed it over the mouth. He restored the
    sheet to its place, and we came away.</p>

    <p>I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the door, he entered, and at once began to
    speak:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem knives.<a name="page_154"
    id="page_154"></a>&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Must we make an autopsy?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes and no. I want to operate, but not as you think. Let me tell you now, but not a word to another. I want to
    cut off her head and take out her heart. Ah! you a surgeon, and so shocked! You, whom I have seen with no tremble of
    hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder. Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend
    John, that you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall operate, and you must only help. I
    would like to do it to-night, but for Arthur I must not; he will be free after his father&rsquo;s funeral to-morrow, and
    he will want to see her&mdash;to see <em>it</em>. Then, when she is coffined ready for the next day, you and I shall
    come when all sleep. We shall unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace all, so that none
    know, save we alone.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But why do it at all? The girl is dead. Why mutilate her poor body without need? And if there is no necessity
    for a post-mortem and nothing to gain by it&mdash;no good to her, to us, to science, to human knowledge&mdash;why do
    it? Without such it is monstrous.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>For answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite tenderness:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Friend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more because it does so bleed. If I could, I
    would take on myself the burden that you do bear. But there are things that you know not, but that you shall know,
    and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant things. John, my child, you have been my friend now many
    years, and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause? I may err&mdash;I am but man; but I believe in all
    I do. Was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came? Yes! Were you not amazed, nay
    horrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love&mdash;though she was dying&mdash;and snatched him away by all
    my strength? Yes! And yet you saw how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so weak, and
    she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? Yes! And did you not hear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her
    eyes grateful? Yes!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, I have good reason now for all I want to do. You have for many years trust me; you have believe me weeks
    past, when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt. Believe me yet a little, friend John. If you
    trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is not perhaps well. And if I work&mdash;as work I shall, no
    matter trust or no trust&mdash;without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy
    heart and feel, oh! so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!&rdquo; He paused a moment and went on
    solemnly: &ldquo;Friend John, there are strange and terrible days before us. Let us not be two, but one, that so we work
    to a good end. Will you not have faith in me?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I took his hand, and promised him. I held my door open as he went away, and watched him go into his room and
    close the door. As I stood without moving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage&mdash;she had her
    back towards me, so did not see me&mdash;and go into the room where Lucy lay. The sight touched me. Devotion is so
    rare, and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl putting aside the
    terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the
    poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....</p>

    
    <p>I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van Helsing waked me by coming into my room.
    He came over to my bedside and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I asked. For his solemnity of the night before had greatly impressed me.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said sternly, &ldquo;it is too late&mdash;or too early. See!&rdquo; Here he held up the little golden crucifix.
    &ldquo;This was stolen in the night.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How, stolen,&rdquo; I asked in wonder, &ldquo;since you have it now?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Because I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the woman who robbed the dead and the living.
    Her punishment will surely come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus unknowing, she
    only stole. Now we must wait.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a new puzzle to grapple with.</p>

    <p>The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr. Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand &amp;
    Lidderdale. He was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all cares as to
    details. During lunch he told us that Mrs. Westenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had
    put her affairs in absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain entailed property of Lucy&rsquo;s
    father&rsquo;s which now, in default of direct issue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate, real and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood. When he had
    told us so much he went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and pointed out certain contingencies that
    might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance.
    Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision, for she asked us if we were or were not
    prepared to carry out her wishes. Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept. We were right in principle,
    and ninety-nine times out of a hundred we should have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.
    Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the
    carrying out of her wishes. For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the
    property, and, even had she only survived her mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no
    will&mdash;and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case&mdash;have been treated at her decease as under
    intestacy. In which case Lord Godalming, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the world; and the
    inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an
    entire stranger. I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.&rdquo;</p>
