    <p>&ldquo;The brave lover, I think, deserve another kiss, which he shall have presently.&rdquo; And as he had now finished his
    operation, he adjusted the pillow to the patient&rsquo;s head. As he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems
    always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a
    little up, and showed a red mark on her throat. Arthur did not notice it, but I
    could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing&rsquo;s ways of betraying emotion. He said nothing
    at the moment, but turned to me, saying: &ldquo;Now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port wine, and let
    him lie down a while. He must then go home and rest, sleep much and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he
    has so given to his love. He must not stay here. Hold! a moment. I may take it, sir, that you are anxious of result.
    Then bring it with you that in all ways the operation is successful. You have saved her life this time, and you can
    go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. I shall tell her all when she is well; she shall love you
    none the less for what you have done. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When Arthur had gone I went back to the room. Lucy was sleeping gently, but her breathing was stronger; I could
    see the counterpane move as her breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently. The velvet
    band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a whisper:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What do you make of that mark on her throat?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have not examined it yet,&rdquo; I answered, and then and there proceeded to loose the band. Just over the external
    jugular vein there were two punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of disease, but the
    edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever
    it was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned the idea as soon as formed, for such a
    thing could not be. The whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost
    to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Van Helsing.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I can make nothing of it.&rdquo; The Professor stood up. &ldquo;I must go back to Amsterdam to-night,&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;There are books and things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you must not let your
    sight pass from her.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Shall I have a nurse?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs
    her. You must not sleep all the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as possible. And
    then we may begin.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;May begin?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What on earth do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We shall see!&rdquo; he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment later
    and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held up:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you shall not sleep easy hereafter!&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary&mdash;continued.</em></p>

    <p><em>8 September.</em>&mdash;I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself off towards dusk, and she waked
    naturally; she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good, and
    she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone.
    When I told Mrs. Westenra that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she almost pooh-poohed the
    idea, pointing out her daughter&rsquo;s renewed strength and excellent spirits. I was firm, however, and made preparations
    for my long vigil. When her maid had prepared her for the night I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and
    took a seat by the bedside. She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me gratefully whenever I caught her
    eye. After a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and
    shook it off. This was repeated several times, with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. It
    was apparent that she did not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You do not want to go to sleep?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No; I am afraid.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Afraid to go to sleep! Why so? It is the boon we all crave for.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ah, not if you were like me&mdash;if sleep was to you a presage of horror!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A presage of horror! What on earth do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; oh, I don&rsquo;t know. And that is what is so terrible. All this weakness comes to me in sleep; until I
    dread the very thought.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. I am here watching you, and I can promise that nothing will
    happen.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ah, I can trust you!&rdquo; I seized the opportunity, and said: &ldquo;I promise you that if I see any evidence of bad
    dreams I will wake you at once.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You will? Oh, will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will sleep!&rdquo; And almost at the word she gave a
    deep sigh of relief, and sank back, asleep.</p>

    <p>All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on in a
    deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with
    the regularity of a pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to
    disturb her peace of mind.</p>

    <p>In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took myself back home, for I was anxious about
    many things. I sent a short wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result of the
    operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to
    inquire about my zo√∂phagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the past day and night. A
    telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham
    to-night, as it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me
    early in the morning.</p>

    
    <p><em>9 September</em>.&mdash;I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly
    had a wink of sleep, and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion. Lucy was up
    and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said:&mdash;</p>
