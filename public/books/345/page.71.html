    <p>Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and said, gravely and sternly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God,
    I shall do it! All I ask you now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when later I make the
    same request you do not be more eager for its fulfilment even than I am, then&mdash;then I shall do my duty,
    whatever it may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship&rsquo;s wishes I shall hold myself at your disposal to
    render an account to you, when and where you will.&rdquo; His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of
    pity:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to
    do, and which sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if the time
    comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away
    all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give
    myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good; at the
    first to please my friend John, and then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her&mdash;I am
    ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness&mdash;I gave what you gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I,
    who was not, like you, her lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights and
    days&mdash;before death, after death; and if my death can do her good even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she
    shall have it freely.&rdquo; He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it. He took the
    old man&rsquo;s hand and said in a broken voice:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I shall go with you and wait.&rdquo;</p>

    DIARY&mdash;<em>continued</em></small></h2>
    <p class="nind">I<small>T</small> was just a quarter before twelve o&rsquo;clock when we got into the churchyard over the
    low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded
    across the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly in front as he led the way. When we
    had come close to the tomb I looked well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so
    sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was
    in some way a counteractant to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural hesitation amongst
    us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the
    door. He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to
    me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that coffin?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo; The Professor turned to the rest saying:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.&rdquo; He took his screwdriver and again took off the
    lid of the coffin. Arthur looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped forward. He evidently
    did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or, at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the
    lead, the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away again, so that he remained of a ghastly
    whiteness; he was still silent. Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and recoiled.</p>

    <p>The coffin was empty!</p>

    <p>For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by Quincey Morris:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn&rsquo;t ask such a thing ordinarily&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t
    so dishonour you as to imply a doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour. Is this your
    doing?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor
    touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and I came here&mdash;with good purpose,
    believe me. I opened that coffin, which was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and saw
    something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in day-time, and she lay there. Did she not,
    friend John?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed
    amongst the graves. Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here all the
    night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of
    those doors garlic, which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last night there was no exodus,
    so to-night before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But
    bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me outside, unseen and unheard, and things much
    stranger are yet to be. So&rdquo;&mdash;here he shut the dark slide of his lantern&mdash;&ldquo;now to the outside.&rdquo; He opened
    the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the door behind him.</p>

    <p>Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault. How sweet it was to see the
    clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing&mdash;like
    the gladness and sorrow of a man&rsquo;s life; how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and
    decay; how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that
    marks the life of a great city. Each in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I could
    see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half
    inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing&rsquo;s conclusions. Quincey Morris was phlegmatic in the
    way of a man who accepts all things, and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to
    stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he
    was employed in a definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like biscuit,
    which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like dough
    or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands. This he then took, and
    rolling it into thin strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the
    door and its setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close, asked him what it was that he was
    doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near also, as they too were curious. He answered:&mdash;</p>
