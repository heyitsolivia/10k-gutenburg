    <p>We had dinner and went to bed early. To-morrow we are to see the Vice-Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about
    getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives. Van Helsing says that our chance will be to get on the boat
    between sunrise and sunset. The Count, even if he takes the form of a bat, cannot cross the running water of his own
    volition, and so cannot leave the ship. As he dare not change to man&rsquo;s form without suspicion&mdash;which he
    evidently wishes to avoid&mdash;he must remain in the box. If, then, we can come on board after sunrise, he is at
    our mercy; for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor Lucy, before he wakes. What mercy he
    shall get from us will not count for much. We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the
    seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything, and we are well supplied with money. We have
    only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warned, and we
    shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I think!</p>

    
    <p><em>16 October.</em>&mdash;Mina&rsquo;s report still the same: lapping waves and rushing water, darkness and favouring
    winds. We are evidently in good time, and when we hear of the <em>Czarina Catherine</em> we<a name="page_313"
    id="page_313"></a> shall be ready. As she must pass the Dardanelles we are sure to have some report.</p>

    <p class="cb">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>

    <p><em>17 October.</em>&mdash;Everything is pretty well fixed now, I think, to welcome the Count on his return from
    his tour. Godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a
    friend of his, and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the
    Captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a similar authorisation to
    his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming&rsquo;s kindly manner to him, and we are
    all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We have already arranged what to do in case we
    get the box open. If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake
    through his heart. Morris and Godalming and I shall prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we
    shall have ready. The Professor says that if we can so treat the Count&rsquo;s body, it will soon after fall into dust. In
    such case there would be no evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. But even if it were
    not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some
    of us and a rope. For myself, I should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come. We mean to leave no
    stone unturned to carry out our intent. We have arranged with certain officials that the instant the <em>Czarina
    Catherine</em> is seen, we are to be informed by a special messenger.</p>

    
    <p><em>24 October.</em>&mdash;A whole week of waiting. Daily telegrams to Godalming, but only the same story: &ldquo;Not yet
    reported.&rdquo; Mina&rsquo;s morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking
    masts.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
      <p class="r"><em>Telegram, October 24th.</em></p>

      <p class="c"><em>Rufus Smith, Lloyd&rsquo;s, London, to Lord Godalming, care of H. B. M.Vice-Consul,
      Varna.</em>&ldquo;<em>Czarina Catherine</em> reported this morning from Dardanelles.&rdquo;</p>

    </div>
    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>25 October.</em>&mdash;How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is irksome to me; but Van Helsing
    says I must. We were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his
    telegram from Lloyd&rsquo;s. I know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. Mrs. Harker, alone of
    our party, did not show any signs of emotion. After all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special
    care not to let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her
    presence. In old days she would, I am sure, have noticed, no matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but in
    this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. The lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems
    strong and well, and is getting back some of her colour, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied. We talk of her often;
    we have not, however, said a word to the others. It would break poor Harker&rsquo;s heart&mdash;certainly his
    nerve&mdash;if he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject. Van Helsing examines, he tells me, her teeth
    very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen
    there is no active danger of a change in her. If this change should come, it would be necessary to take steps!... We
    both know what those steps would have to be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. We should neither
    of us shrink from the task&mdash;awful though it be to contemplate. &ldquo;Euthanasia&rdquo; is an excellent and a comforting
    word! I am grateful to whoever invented it.</p>

    <p>It is only about 24 hours&rsquo; sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the rate the <em>Czarina Catherine</em> has come
    from London. She should therefore arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in before then, we
    are all about to retire early. We shall get up at one o&rsquo;clock, so as to be ready.</p>

    
    <p><em>25 October, Noon</em>.&mdash;No news yet of the ship&rsquo;s arrival. Mrs. Harker&rsquo;s hypnotic report this morning was
    the same as usual, so it is possible that we may get news at any moment. We men are all in a fever of excitement,
    except Harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great
    Ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him. It will be a bad lookout for the Count if the edge of that
    &ldquo;Kukri&rdquo; ever touches his throat, driven by that stern, ice-cold hand!</p>

    <p>Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs. Harker to-day. About noon she got into a sort of lethargy
    which we did not like; although we kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. She had been
    restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know that she was sleeping. When,<a name="page_315"
    id="page_315"></a> however, her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake
    her, we went to her room to see for ourselves. She was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we
    agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else. Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no
    wonder that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.</p>
