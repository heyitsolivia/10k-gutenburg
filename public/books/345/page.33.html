    
    <p><em>Same day, noon.</em>&mdash;All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed not to have even changed her
    side. The adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she
    looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin
    hurt her. Indeed, it might have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. I must have pinched up a
    piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are two little red points
    like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood. When I apologised and was concerned about
    it, she laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. Fortunately it cannot leave a scar, as it is so
    tiny.</p>

    
    <p><em>Same day, night.</em>&mdash;We passed a happy day. The air was clear, and the sun bright, and there was a cool
    breeze. We took our lunch to Mulgrave Woods, Mrs. Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the
    cliff-path and joining her at the gate. I felt a little sad myself, for I could not but feel how <em>absolutely</em>
    happy it would have been had Jonathan been with me. But there! I must only be patient. In the evening we strolled in
    the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr and Mackenzie, and went to bed early. Lucy seems more restful
    than she has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. I shall lock the door and secure the key the same as
    before, though I do not expect any trouble to-night.</p>

    
    <p><em>12 August.</em>&mdash;My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I was wakened by Lucy trying to
    get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed
    under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and heard the birds chirping outside of the window. Lucy woke, too,
    and, I was glad to see, was even better than on the previous morning. All her old gaiety of manner seemed to have
    come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about Arthur. I told her how anxious I was about
    Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. Well, she succeeded somewhat, for, though sympathy can&rsquo;t alter facts, it
    can help to make them more bearable.</p>

    
    <p><em>13 August.</em>&mdash;Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as before. Again I awoke in the
    night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed, still asleep, pointing to the window. I got up quietly, and pulling aside
    the blind, looked out. It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft effect of the light over the sea and
    sky&mdash;merged together in one great, silent mystery&mdash;was beautiful beyond words. Between me and the
    moonlight flitted a great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. Once or twice it came quite close, but
    was, I suppose, frightened at seeing me, and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. When I came back
    from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully. She did not stir again all night.</p>

    
    <p><em>14 August.</em>&mdash;On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day. Lucy seems to have become as much in love
    with the spot as I am, and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or
    dinner. This afternoon she made a funny remark. We were coming home for dinner, and had come to the top of the steps
    up from the West Pier and stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. The setting sun, low down in the sky, was
    just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to
    bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow. We were silent for a while, and suddenly Lucy murmured as if to
    herself:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;His red eyes again! They are just the same.&rdquo; It was such an odd expression, coming <em>apropos</em> of nothing,
    that it quite startled me. I slewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare at her, and saw
    that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look on her face that I could not quite make out; so I said
    nothing, but followed her eyes. She appeared to be looking over at our own seat, whereon was a dark figure seated
    alone. I was a little startled myself, for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning
    flames; but a second look dispelled the illusion. The red sunlight was shining on the windows of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church
    behind our seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it
    appear as if the light moved. I called Lucy&rsquo;s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself with a start,
    but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there. We never
    refer to it; so I said nothing, and we went home to dinner. Lucy had a headache and went early to bed. I saw her
    asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself; I walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet
    sadness, for I was thinking of Jonathan. When coming home&mdash;it was then bright moonlight, so bright that, though
    the front of our part of the Crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen&mdash;I threw a glance up at our
    window, and saw Lucy&rsquo;s head leaning out. I thought that perhaps she was looking out for me, so I opened my
    handkerchief and waved it. She did not notice or make any movement whatever. Just then, the moonlight crept round an
    angle of the building, and the light fell on the window. There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against
    the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. She was fast asleep, and by her, seated on the window-sill, was
    something that looked like a good-sized bird. I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came
    into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast asleep, and breathing
    heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat, as though to protect it from cold.</p>

    <p>I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely
    fastened.</p>

    <p>She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and there is a drawn, haggard look under her
    eyes which I do not like. I fear she is fretting about something. I wish I could find out what it is.</p>

    
    <p><em>15 August.</em>&mdash;Rose later than usual. Lucy was languid and tired, and slept on after we had been called.
    We had a happy surprise at breakfast. Arthur&rsquo;s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. Lucy is
    full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on in the day she told me the cause. She is
    grieved to lose Lucy as her very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to protect her. Poor
    dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got her death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise
    secrecy; her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for her heart is weakening. At any
    time, even now, a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her. Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of the
    dreadful night of Lucy&rsquo;s sleep-walking.</p>
