    <p>&ldquo;In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of everything left in my charge.... With
    regard to patient, Renfield, there is more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a dreadful
    ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended with any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier&rsquo;s
    cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours&mdash;the house to which, you will
    remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were
    strangers. I was myself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and saw one of them come up to
    the house. As he passed the window of Renfield&rsquo;s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called him all
    the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling
    him to &ldquo;shut up for a foul-mouthed beggar,&rdquo; whereon our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and
    said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,
    so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to
    by saying: ‘Lor&rsquo; bless yer, sir, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind what was said to me in a bloomin&rsquo; madhouse. I pity ye and the
    guv&rsquo;nor for havin&rsquo; to live in the house with a wild beast like that.&rsquo; Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I
    told him where the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats and curses and revilings from our
    man. I went down to see if I could make out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a well-behaved man,
    and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed
    and most genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me questions as to
    what I meant, and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to say,
    however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken
    out through the window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the attendants to follow me, and
    ran after him, for I feared he was intent on some mischief. My fear was
    justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden
    boxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent exercise. Before I
    could get up to him the patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his head
    against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the moment I believe he would have killed the man there and
    then. The other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his heavy whip. It was a
    terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us
    to and fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others were both burly men. At first he was
    silent in his fighting; but as we began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat on him, he
    began to shout: ‘I&rsquo;ll frustrate them! They shan&rsquo;t rob me! they shan&rsquo;t murder me by inches! I&rsquo;ll fight for my Lord
    and Master!&rsquo; and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable difficulty that they got him
    back to the house and put him in the padded room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set
    it all right; and he is going on well.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages, and promised to rain all the
    penalties of the law on us. Their threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat
    of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent
    in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him. They gave as another
    reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of
    their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labours of any place of public
    entertainment. I quite understood their drift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and with
    each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day
    for the pleasure of meeting so ‘bloomin&rsquo; good a bloke&rsquo; as your correspondent. I took their names and addresses, in
    case they might be needed. They are as follows:&mdash;Jack Smollet, of Dudding&rsquo;s Rents, King George&rsquo;s Road, Great
    Walworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley&rsquo;s Row, Guide Court, Bethnal Green. They are both in the employment of
    Harris &amp; Sons, Moving and Shipment Company, Orange Master&rsquo;s Yard, Soho.<a name="page_147"

    <p class="letra"><em>Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra</em>.(Unopened by her.)</p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;<em>18 September.</em></p>

    <p class="nind">&ldquo;My dearest Lucy,&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly. Some may not think it so sad for us, but we
    had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either father or
    mother, so that the dear old man&rsquo;s death is a real blow to me. Jonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that
    he feels sorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life, and now at the end has
    treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the
    dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon
    him makes him nervous. He begins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and <em>my</em> belief in <em>him</em> helps
    him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most.
    Oh, it is too hard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his&mdash;a nature which enabled him by our
    dear, good friend&rsquo;s aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years&mdash;should be so injured that the very essence
    of its strength is gone. Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness; but,
    Lucy dear, I must tell some one, for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to Jonathan tries me,
    and I have no one here that I can confide in. I dread coming up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow;
    for poor Mr. Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father. As there are no
    relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief mourner. I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a
    few minutes. Forgive me for troubling you. With all blessings,</p>
