    <p>&ldquo;No, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it I have so much in memory of you that is
    sweet, that I take it all together. Now, you must all be going soon. Breakfast is ready, and we must all eat that we
    may be strong.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Breakfast was a strange meal to us all. We tried to be cheerful and encourage each other, and Mina was the
    brightest and most cheerful of us. When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. Are we all armed, as we were on that night when
    first we visited our enemy&rsquo;s lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?&rdquo; We all assured him. &ldquo;Then it is
    well. Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case <em>quite</em> safe here until the sunset; and before then we shall
    return&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash; We shall return! But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack. I have
    myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know, so that He may not
    enter. Now let me guard yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the name of the Father, the
    Son, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he had placed the Wafer on Mina&rsquo;s forehead,
    it had seared it&mdash;had burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal. My poor darling&rsquo;s
    brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerves
    received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful
    scream. But the words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when
    there came the reaction, and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. Pulling her beautiful hair
    over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead
    until the Judgment Day.&rdquo; They all paused. I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief, and putting
    my arms around held her tight. For a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us
    turned away their eyes that ran tears silently. Then Van Helsing turned and said gravely; so gravely that I could
    not help feeling that he was in some way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It may be that you may have to bear that mark till God himself see fit, as He most surely shall, on the Judgment
    Day, to redress all wrongs of the earth and of His children that He has placed thereon. And oh, Madam Mina, my dear,
    my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that red scar, the sign of God&rsquo;s knowledge of what has been,
    shall pass away, and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. For so surely as we live, that scar shall
    pass away when God sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us. Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did
    in obedience to His Will. It may be that we are chosen instruments of His good pleasure, and that we ascend to His
    bidding as that other through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and fears, and all that
    makes the difference between God and man.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation. Mina and I both felt so, and
    simultaneously we each took one of the old man&rsquo;s hands and bent over and kissed it. Then without a word we all knelt
    down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each other. We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of
    sorrow from the head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible
    task which lay before us.</p>

    <p>It was then time to start. So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which neither of us shall forget to our dying
    day; and we set out.</p>

    <p>To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be a vampire in the end, then she shall not go
    into that unknown and terrible land alone. I suppose it is thus that in old
    times one vampire meant many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so the holiest love was
    the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.</p>

    <p>We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion. It was hard to believe
    that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we
    knew. Had not our minds been made up, and had there not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have
    proceeded with our task. We found no papers, or any sign of use in the house; and in the old chapel the great boxes
    looked just as we had seen them last. Dr. Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And now, my friends, we have a duty here to do. We must sterilise this earth, so sacred of holy memories, that
    he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use. He has chosen this earth because it has been holy. Thus we
    defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more holy still. It was sanctified to such use of man, now we
    sanctify it to God.&rdquo; As he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench, and very soon the top of one of
    the cases was thrown open. The earth smelled musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention
    was concentrated on the Professor. Taking from his box a piece of the Sacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the
    earth, and then shutting down the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.</p>

    <p>One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left them as we had found them to all
    appearance; but in each was a portion of the Host.</p>

    <p>When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;So much is already done. If it may be that with all the others we can be so successful, then the sunset of this
    evening may shine on Madam Mina&rsquo;s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>As we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum. I
    looked eagerly, and in the window of my own room saw Mina. I waved my hand to her, and nodded to tell that our work
    there was successfully accomplished. She nodded in reply to show that she understood. The last I saw, she was waving
    her hand in farewell. It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught the train, which was
    steaming in as we reached the platform.</p>

    <p>I have written this in the train.</p>

    
    <p><em>Piccadilly, 12:30 o&rsquo;clock.</em>&mdash;Just before we reached Fenchurch Street Lord Godalming said to
    me:&mdash;</p>
