    <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I am sick of all that rubbish!&rdquo; He certainly is a wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could
    get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. Stop; there may be a clue after all, if we can
    find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset. Can it be that there is a malign influence of the
    sun at periods which affects certain natures&mdash;as at times the moon does others? We shall see.</p>

    <p class="nind">&ldquo;My dear Art,&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My news to-day is not so good. Lucy this morning had gone back a bit. There is, however, one good thing which
    has arisen from it; Mrs. Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me professionally about
    her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was
    coming to stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with myself; so now we can come and go
    without alarming her unduly, for a shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy&rsquo;s weak condition, might
    be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall
    come through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you do not hear from me, take it for granted
    that I am simply waiting for news. In haste</p>

    <p class="r">Yours ever,&ldquo;<span class="smcap">John Seward.</span>&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>7 September.</em>&mdash;The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at Liverpool Street was:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I waited till I had seen you, as I said in my telegram. I wrote him a letter simply telling him
    that you were coming, as Miss Westenra was not so well, and that I should let him know if need be.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Right, my friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;quite right! Better he not know as yet; perhaps he shall never know. I pray so; but
    if it be needed, then he shall know all. And, my good friend John, let me caution you. You deal with the madmen. All
    men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with God&rsquo;s
    madmen, too&mdash;the rest of the world. You tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it; you tell them not
    what you think. So you shall keep knowledge in its place, where it may
    rest&mdash;where it may gather its kind around it and breed. You and I shall keep as yet what we know here, and
    here.&rdquo; He touched me on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself the same way. &ldquo;I have for myself
    thoughts at the present. Later I shall unfold to you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why not now?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;It may do some good; we may arrive at some decision.&rdquo; He stopped and looked at me, and
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has ripened&mdash;while the milk of its mother-earth is
    in him, and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him
    between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff, and say to you: â€˜Look! he&rsquo;s good corn; he will make good
    crop when the time comes.&rsquo;&rdquo; I did not see the application, and told him so. For reply he reached over and took
    my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as he used long ago to do at lectures, and said: &ldquo;The good husbandman
    tell you so then because he knows, but not till then. But you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted
    corn to see if he grow; that is for the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of the work
    of their life. See you now, friend John? I have sown my corn, and Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if
    he sprout at all, there&rsquo;s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.&rdquo; He broke off, for he evidently saw
    that I understood. Then he went on, and very gravely:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more full than the rest. You were only student
    then; now you are master, and I trust that good habit have not fail. Remember, my friend, that knowledge is stronger
    than memory, and we should not trust the weaker. Even if you have not kept the good practise, let me tell you that
    this case of our dear miss is one that may be&mdash;mind, I say <em>may be</em>&mdash;of such interest to us and
    others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam, as your peoples say. Take then good note of it. Nothing is
    too small. I counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises. Hereafter it may be of interest to you
    to see how true you guess. We learn from failure, not from success!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When I described Lucy&rsquo;s symptoms&mdash;the same as before, but infinitely more marked&mdash;he looked very grave,
    but said nothing. He took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs, &ldquo;the ghastly paraphernalia of our
    beneficial trade,&rdquo; as he once called, in one of his lectures, the equipment of a professor of the healing craft.
    When we were shown in, Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so
    much as I expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote
    to its own terrors. Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or
    other, the things not personal&mdash;even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attached&mdash;do
    not seem to reach her. It is something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some
    insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered
    selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism, for there may be deeper root for
    its causes than we have knowledge of.</p>
