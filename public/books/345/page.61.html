    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see where the joke comes in there either!&rdquo; I said; and I did not feel particularly pleased with him for
    saying such things. He laid his hand on my arm, and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others when it would wound, but only to you, my
    old friend, whom I can trust. If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh; if you could
    have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is
    to him&mdash;for he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time&mdash;maybe you would perhaps pity me the
    most of all.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Because I know!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will sit over our roofs with brooding wings.
    Lucy lies in the tomb of her kin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming London; where the
    air is fresh, and the sun rises over Hampstead Hill, and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.</p>

    <p>So I can finish this diary; and God only knows if I shall ever begin another. If I do, or if I even open this
    again, it will be to deal with different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the romance of my
    life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my life-work, I say sadly and without hope,</p>

    <p class="letra">A HAMPSTEAD MYSTERY.</p>

    <p>The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines
    parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as &ldquo;The Kensington Horror,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Stabbing Woman,&rdquo;
    or &ldquo;The Woman in Black.&rdquo; During the past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying
    from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all these cases the children were too young to
    give any properly intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses is that they had been with
    a &ldquo;bloofer lady.&rdquo; It has always been late in the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the
    children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is generally supposed in the neighbourhood
    that, as the first child missed gave as his reason for being away that a &ldquo;bloofer lady&rdquo; had asked him to come for a
    walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite
    game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A correspondent writes us that to see some of
    the tiny tots pretending to be the &ldquo;bloofer lady&rdquo; is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists might, he says, take
    a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general
    principles of human nature that the &ldquo;bloofer lady&rdquo; should be the popular rôle at these <em>al fresco</em>
    performances. Our correspondent naïvely says that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of
    these grubby-faced little children pretend&mdash;and even imagine themselves&mdash;to be.</p>

    <p>There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of the children, indeed all who have been
    missed at night, have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or
    a small dog, and although of not much importance individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them
    has a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp look-out for
    straying children, especially when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog which may be
    about.</p>

    CHILD INJURED.<em>The &ldquo;Bloofer Lady.&rdquo;</em></p>

    <p>We have just received intelligence that another child, missed last night, was only discovered late in the morning
    under a furze bush at the Shooter&rsquo;s Hill side of Hampstead Heath, which is, perhaps, less frequented than the other
    parts. It has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed in other cases. It was terribly weak, and looked
    quite emaciated. It too, when partially restored, had the common story to tell of being lured away by the &ldquo;bloofer
    lady.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><em>23 September</em>.&mdash;Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that he has plenty of work to do,
    for that keeps his mind off the terrible things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the
    responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself, and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan
    rising to the height of his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon him. He will be
    away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch at home. My household work is done, so I shall take his
    foreign journal, and lock myself up in my room and read it....</p>

    <p><em>24 September</em>.&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to write last night; that terrible record of Jonathan&rsquo;s upset me
    so. Poor dear! How he must have suffered, whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth in
    it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those terrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I
    suppose I shall never know, for I dare not open the subject to him.... And yet that man we saw yesterday! He seemed
    quite certain of him.... Poor fellow! I suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some train of
    thought.... He believes it all himself. I remember how on our wedding-day he said: &ldquo;Unless some solemn duty come
    upon me to go back to the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.&rdquo; There seems to be through it all some thread
    of continuity.... That fearful Count was coming to London.... If it should be, and he came to London, with his
    teeming millions.... There may be a solemn duty; and if it come we must not shrink from it.... I shall be prepared.
    I shall get my typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing. Then we shall be ready for other eyes if required.
    And if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if I am ready, poor Jonathan may not be upset, for I can speak for him and never
    let him be troubled or worried with it at all. If ever Jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want to tell
    me of it all, and I can ask him questions and find out things, and see how I may comfort him.<a name="page_168"
