    
    <p><em>19 August.</em>&mdash;Joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. At last, news of Jonathan. The dear fellow has been
    ill; that is why he did not write. I am not afraid to think it or say it, now that I know. Mr. Hawkins sent me on
    the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. I am to leave in the morning and go over to Jonathan, and to help to
    nurse him if necessary, and to bring him home. Mr. Hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if we were to be married
    out there. I have cried over the good Sister&rsquo;s letter till I can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. It is
    of Jonathan, and must be next my heart, for he is <em>in</em> my heart. My journey is all mapped out, and my luggage
    ready. I am only taking one change of dress; Lucy will bring my trunk to London and keep it till I send for it, for
    it may be that ... I must write no more; I must keep it to say to Jonathan, my husband. The letter that he has seen
    and touched must comfort me till we meet.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Letter, Sister Agatha, Hospital of St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, Buda-Pesth, to Miss Wilhelmina
    Murray.</em></p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;<em>12 August.</em></p>

    <p class="nind">&ldquo;Dear Madam,&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I write by desire of Mr. Jonathan Harker, who is himself not strong enough to write, though progressing well,
    thanks to God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary. He has been under our care for nearly six weeks, suffering from a
    violent brain fever. He wishes me to convey his love, and to say that by this post I write for him to Mr. Peter
    Hawkins, Exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that he is sorry for his delay, and that all of his work is
    completed. He will require some few weeks&rsquo; rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return. He wishes me
    to say that he has not sufficient money with him, and that he would like to pay
    for his staying here, so that others who need shall not be wanting for help.</p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;Believe me,&ldquo;Yours, with sympathy and all blessings,&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sister Agatha</span>.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;P. S.&mdash;My patient being asleep, I open this to let you know something more. He has told me all about you,
    and that you are shortly to be his wife. All blessings to you both! He has had some fearful shock&mdash;so says our
    doctor&mdash;and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and
    demons; and I fear to say of what. Be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him of this kind
    for a long time to come; the traces of such an illness as his do not lightly die away. We should have written long
    ago, but we knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one could understand. He came in the
    train from Klausenburg, and the guard was told by the station-master there that he rushed into the station shouting
    for a ticket for home. Seeing from his violent demeanour that he was English, they gave him a ticket for the
    furthest station on the way thither that the train reached.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Be assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by his sweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting
    on well, and I have no doubt will in a few weeks be all himself. But be careful of him for safety&rsquo;s sake. There are,
    I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many, many, happy years for you both.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>19 August.</em>&mdash;Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About eight o&rsquo;clock he began to get
    excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting. The attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest
    in him, encouraged him to talk. He is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the
    man tells me, he was quite haughty. Would not condescend to talk with him at all. All he would say was:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you: you don&rsquo;t count now; the Master is at hand.&rdquo;</p>

    </div>
    <p>The attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has seized him. If so, we must look out for
    squalls, for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. The combination is a
    dreadful one. At nine o&rsquo;clock I visited him myself. His attitude to me was the same as that to<a name="page_095"
    id="page_095"></a> the attendant; in his sublime self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to
    him as nothing. It looks like religious mania, and he will soon think that he himself is God. These infinitesimal
    distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an Omnipotent Being. How these madmen give themselves away! The
    real God taketh heed lest a sparrow fall; but the God created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle
    and a sparrow. Oh, if men only knew!</p>

    <p>For half an hour or more Renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree. I did not pretend to be
    watching him, but I kept strict observation all the same. All at once that shifty look came into his eyes which we
    always see when a madman has seized an idea, and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum
    attendants come to know so well. He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly, and
    looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. I thought I would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and
    tried to lead him to talk of his pets, a theme which had never failed to excite his attention. At first he made no
    reply, but at length said testily:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Bother them all! I don&rsquo;t care a pin about them.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me you don&rsquo;t care about spiders?&rdquo; (Spiders at present are his hobby and
    the note-book is filling up with columns of small figures.) To this he answered enigmatically:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride; but when the bride draweth nigh, then the
    maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed all the time I remained with him.</p>

    <p>I am weary to-night and low in spirits. I cannot but think of Lucy, and how different things might have been. If
    I don&rsquo;t sleep at once, chloral, the modern Morpheus&mdash;C<sub>2</sub>HCl<sub>3</sub>O. H<sub>2</sub>O! I must be
    careful not to let it grow into a habit. No, I shall take none to-night! I have thought of Lucy, and I shall not
    dishonour her by mixing the two. If need be, to-night shall be sleepless....</p>
