    <p>&ldquo;That &rsquo;ere &rsquo;ouse, guv&rsquo;nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it ain&rsquo;t been touched sence a hundred years.
    There was dust that thick in the place that you might have slep&rsquo; on it without &rsquo;urtin&rsquo; of yer bones; an&rsquo; the place
    was that neglected that yer might &rsquo;ave smelled ole Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel&mdash;that took the cike,
    that did! Me and my mate, we thort we wouldn&rsquo;t never git out quick enough. Lor&rsquo;, I wouldn&rsquo;t take less nor a quid a
    moment to stay there arter dark.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what I know, he would, I think, have raised
    his terms.</p>

    <p>Of one thing I am now satisfied: that <em>all</em> the boxes which arrived at Whitby from Varna in the
    <em>Demeter</em> were safely deposited in the old chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any
    have since been removed&mdash;as from Dr. Seward&rsquo;s diary I fear.</p>

    <p>I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when Renfield attacked them. By following up
    this clue we may learn a good deal.</p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;Mina and I have worked all day, and we have put all the papers into order.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Mina Harker&rsquo;s Journal</em></p>

    <p><em>30 September.</em>&mdash;I am so glad that I hardly know how to contain myself. It is, I suppose, the reaction
    from the haunting fear which I have had: that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act
    detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a face as I could, but I was sick with
    apprehension. The effort has, however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never so full of
    volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he
    improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and hope and determination; we have
    got everything in order for to-night. I feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any
    thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not human&mdash;not even beast. To read Dr. Seward&rsquo;s
    account of poor Lucy&rsquo;s death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in one&rsquo;s heart.</p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we expected. Dr. Seward was out on
    business, and had taken Jonathan with him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it brought back
    all poor dear Lucy&rsquo;s hopes of only a few months ago. Of course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that
    Dr. Van Helsing, too, has been quite &ldquo;blowing my trumpet,&rdquo; as Mr. Morris expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them
    is aware that I know all about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to say or do, as they
    were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter
    over, and came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post them in affairs right up to date. I
    knew from Dr. Seward&rsquo;s diary that they had been at Lucy&rsquo;s death&mdash;her real death&mdash;and that I need not fear
    to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I could, that I had read all the papers and
    diaries, and that my husband and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order. I gave them
    each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got his and turned it over&mdash;it does make a pretty good
    pile&mdash;he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I nodded, and he went on:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and kind, and have been working so earnestly
    and so energetically, that all I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have had one lesson
    already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my
    poor Lucy&mdash;&rdquo; Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear the tears in his voice. Mr.
    Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the
    room. I suppose there is something in woman&rsquo;s nature that makes a man free to break down before her and express his
    feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when Lord Godalming found
    himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his
    hand. I hope he didn&rsquo;t think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a
    thought. There I wrong him; I <em>know</em> he never will&mdash;he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I could
    see that his heart was breaking:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to her. She and I were like sisters; and
    now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have had,
    though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can help in your affliction, won&rsquo;t you let me be of
    some little service&mdash;for Lucy&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed to me that all that he had of late been
    suffering in silence found a vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat his palms
    together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I
    felt an infinite pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried
    like a wearied child, whilst he shook with emotion.</p>

    <p>We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the mother-spirit is
    invoked; I felt this big sorrowing man&rsquo;s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby that some day may
    lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it
    all was.</p>

    <p>After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an apology, though he made no disguise of his
    emotion. He told me that for days and nights past&mdash;weary days and sleepless nights&mdash;he had been unable to
    speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of sorrow. There was no
    woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow
    was surrounded, he could speak freely. &ldquo;I know now how I suffered,&rdquo; he said, as he dried his eyes, &ldquo;but I do not
    know even yet&mdash;and none other can ever know&mdash;how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall
    know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful now, my gratitude will grow with my
    understanding. You will let me be like a brother, will you not, for all our lives&mdash;for dear Lucy&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;</p>
