    <p>&ldquo;What was the name of the man who took it?&rdquo; asked Dr. Van Helsing with restrained eagerness.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be tellin&rsquo; ye quick!&rdquo; he answered, and, stepping down to his cabin, produced a receipt signed &ldquo;Immanuel
    Hildesheim.&rdquo; Burgen-strasse 16 was the address. We found out that this was all the Captain knew; so with thanks we
    came away.</p>

    <p>We found Hildesheim in his office, a Hebrew of rather the Adelphi Theatre
    type, with a nose like a sheep, and a fez. His arguments were pointed with specie&mdash;we doing the
    punctuation&mdash;and with a little bargaining he told us what he knew. This turned out to be simple but important.
    He had received a letter from Mr. de Ville of London, telling him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to
    avoid customs, a box which would arrive at Galatz in the <em>Czarina Catherine</em>. This he was to give in charge to
    a certain Petrof Skinsky, who dealt with the Slovaks who traded down the river to the port. He had been paid for his
    work by an English bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the Danube International Bank. When Skinsky had
    come to him, he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. That was all he
    knew.</p>

    <p>We then sought for Skinsky, but were unable go find him. One of his neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any
    affection, said that he had gone away two days before, no one knew whither. This was corroborated by his landlord,
    who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due, in English money. This had been
    between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock last night. We were at a standstill again.</p>

    <p>Whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of Skinsky had been found
    inside the wall of the churchyard of St. Peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal.
    Those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the women crying out &ldquo;This is the work of a Slovak!&rdquo; We
    hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.</p>

    <p>As we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion. We were all convinced that the box was on its way, by
    water, to somewhere; but where that might be we would have to discover. With heavy hearts we came home to the hotel
    to Mina.</p>

    <p>When we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking Mina again into our confidence. Things are
    getting desperate, and it is at least a chance, though a hazardous one. As a preliminary step, I was released from
    my promise to her.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Mina Harker&rsquo;s Journal.</em></p>

    <p><em>30 October, evening.</em>&mdash;They were so tired and worn out and dispirited that there was nothing to be
    done till they had some rest; so I asked them all to lie down for half an hour whilst I should enter everything up
    to the moment. I feel so grateful to the man who invented the &ldquo;Traveller&rsquo;s&rdquo; typewriter, and to<a name="page_328"
    id="page_328"></a> Mr. Morris for getting this one for me. I should have felt quite; astray doing the work if I had
    to write with a pen....</p>

    <p>It is all done; poor dear, dear Jonathan, what he must have suffered, what must he be suffering now. He lies on
    the sofa hardly seeming to breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. His brows are knit; his face is drawn
    with pain. Poor fellow, maybe he is thinking, and I can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his
    thoughts. Oh! if I could only help at all.... I shall do what I can.</p>

    <p>I have asked Dr. Van Helsing, and he has got me all the papers that I have not yet seen.... Whilst they are
    resting, I shall go over all carefully, and perhaps I may arrive at some conclusion. I shall try to follow the
    Professor&rsquo;s example, and think without prejudice on the facts before me....</p>

    
    <p>I do believe that under God&rsquo;s providence I have made a discovery. I shall get the maps and look over
    them....</p>

    
    <p>I am more than ever sure that I am right. My new conclusion is ready, so I shall get our party together and read
    it. They can judge it; it is well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Mina Harker&rsquo;s Memorandum.</em></p>

    <p class="c">(Entered in her Journal.)</p>

    <p><em>Ground of inquiry.</em>&mdash;Count Dracula&rsquo;s problem is to get back to his own place.</p>

    <p>(<em>a</em>) He must be <em>brought back</em> by some one. This is evident; for had he power to move himself as he
    wished he could go either as man, or wolf, or bat, or in some other way. He evidently fears discovery or
    interference, in the state of helplessness in which he must be&mdash;confined as he is between dawn and sunset in
    his wooden box.</p>

    <p>(<em>b</em>) <em>How is he to be taken?</em>&mdash;Here a process of exclusions may help us. By road, by rail, by
    water?</p>

    <p>1. <em>By Road.</em>&mdash;There are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the city.</p>

    <p>(<em>x</em>) There are people; and people are curious, and investigate. A hint, a surmise, a doubt as to what might
    be in the box, would destroy him.</p>

    <p>(<em>y</em>) There are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.</p>

    <p>(<em>z</em>) His pursuers might follow. This is his highest fear; and in order
    to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled, so far as he can, even his victim&mdash;me!</p>

    <p>2. <em>By Rail.</em>&mdash;There is no one in charge of the box. It would have to take its chance of being delayed;
    and delay would be fatal, with enemies on the track. True, he might escape at night; but what would he be, if left
    in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to? This is not what he intends; and he does not mean to risk
    it.</p>

    <p>3. <em>By Water.</em>&mdash;Here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most danger in another. On the water
    he is powerless except at night; even then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. But were he
    wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and he would indeed be lost. He could have the vessel drive to
    land; but if it were unfriendly land, wherein he was not free to move, his position would still be desperate.</p>

    <p>We know from the record that he was on the water; so what we have to do is to ascertain <em>what</em> water.</p>

    <p>The first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet; we may, then, get a light on what his later task
    is to be.</p>

    <p><em>Firstly.</em>&mdash;We must differentiate between what he did in London as part of his general plan of action,
    when he was pressed for moments and had to arrange as best he could.</p>

    <p><em>Secondly</em> we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we know of, what he has done here.</p>
