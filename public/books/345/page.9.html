    <p>&ldquo;The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old <em>Quatre Face</em>, as the house is four-sided,
    agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by the
    solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep,
    dark-looking pond or small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and flows away in a fair-sized
    stream. The house is very large and of all periods back, I should say, to medi√¶val times, for one part is of stone
    immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is
    close to an old chapel or church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading to it from the
    house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from various points. The house has been added to, but in a very
    straggling way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must be very great. There are but few
    houses close at hand, one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum.
    It is not, however, visible from the grounds.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When I had finished, he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to live in a new house would kill me. A
    house cannot be made habitable in a day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice also that
    there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common
    dead. I seek not gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please
    the young and gay. I am no longer young; and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not attuned
    to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the
    broken battlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would be
    alone with my thoughts when I may.&rdquo; Somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord, or else it was that his
    cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine.</p>

    <p>Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers together. He was some little time away, and
    I began to look at some of the books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at England, as if
    that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in certain places little rings marked, and on examining these
    I noticed that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new estate was situated; the other two
    were Exeter, and Whitby on the Yorkshire coast.</p>

    <p>It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;still at your books? Good! But you
    must not work always. Come; I am informed that your supper is ready.&rdquo; He took my arm, and we went into the next
    room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on
    his being away from home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate. After supper I smoked, as
    on the last evening, and the Count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour
    after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation to
    meet my host&rsquo;s wishes in every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me; but I could not
    help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of
    the tide. They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the
    tide; any one who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere can
    well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear
    morning air; Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so long. You must make your conversation
    regarding my dear new country of England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by us,&rdquo; and, with
    a courtly bow, he quickly left me.</p>

    <p>I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to notice; my window opened into the
    courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have written of
    this day.</p>

    
    <p><em>8 May.</em>&mdash;I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too diffuse; but now I am glad
    that I went into detail from the first, for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that I
    cannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had never come. It may be that this strange
    night-existence is telling on me; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I could bear it,
    but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with, and he!&mdash;I fear I am myself the only living soul
    within the place. Let me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and imagination must not run
    riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say at once how I stand&mdash;or seem to.</p>

    <p>I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my
    shaving glass by the window, and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder, and heard the
    Count&rsquo;s voice saying to me, &ldquo;Good-morning.&rdquo; I started, for it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the
    reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly, but did not notice
    it at the moment. Having answered the Count&rsquo;s salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been
    mistaken. This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder. But
    there was no reflection of him in the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no sign of a man
    in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to
    increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at the instant I saw that
    the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half
    round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury,
    and he suddenly made a grab at my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which held the
    crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was
    ever there.</p>
