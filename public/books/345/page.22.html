    <p><em>24 July. Whitby.</em>&mdash;Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and lovelier than ever, and we drove up
    to the house at the Crescent in which they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the Esk, runs
    through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the harbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high
    piers, through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is beautifully green, and it
    is so steep that when you are on the high land on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough
    to see down. The houses of the old town&mdash;the side away from us&mdash;are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one
    over the other anyhow, like the pictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby Abbey, which
    was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of &ldquo;Marmion,&rdquo; where the girl was built up in the wall. It is
    a most noble ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is a legend that a white lady is
    seen in one of the windows. Between it and the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big
    graveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right over the town,
    and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness stretches out into the
    sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been
    destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below. There
    are walks, with seats beside them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long looking at the
    beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and sit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing
    now, with my book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me. They seem to do
    nothing all day but sit up here and talk.</p>

    <p>The harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall stretching out into the sea, with a curve
    outwards at the end of it, in the middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside of it. On the
    near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely, and its end too has a
    lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.</p>

    <p>It is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to nothing, and there is merely the stream of
    the Esk, running between banks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this side there rises for
    about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the
    end of it is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a mournful sound on the wind. They have a
    legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he is coming
    this way....</p>

    <p>He is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree.
    He tells me that he is nearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing fleet when Waterloo was
    fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical person, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady
    at the abbey he said very brusquely:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t fash masel&rsquo; about them, miss. Them things be all wore out. Mind, I don&rsquo;t say that they never was, but
    I do say that they wasn&rsquo;t in my time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an&rsquo; the like, but not for a
    nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and Leeds that be always eatin&rsquo; cured herrin&rsquo;s an&rsquo; drinkin&rsquo; tea
    an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel&rsquo; who&rsquo;d be bothered tellin&rsquo; lies to
    them&mdash;even the newspapers, which is full of fool-talk.&rdquo; I thought he would be a good person to learn
    interesting things from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about the whale-fishing in the old
    days. He was just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn&rsquo;t like to be kept waitin&rsquo; when the tea is ready,
    for it takes me time to crammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of &rsquo;em; an&rsquo;, miss, I lack belly-timber sairly
    by the clock.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down the steps. The steps are a great feature
    on the place. They lead from the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them&mdash;I do not know how
    many&mdash;and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down
    them. I think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did not go. They
    will be home by this.</p>

    
    <p><em>1 August.</em>&mdash;I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most interesting talk with my old
    friend and the two others who always come and join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think
    must have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit anything, and downfaces everybody. If he
    can&rsquo;t out-argue them he bullies them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy was looking
    sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the
    old men did not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down. She is so sweet with old people; I
    think they all fell in love with her on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but gave me
    double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends, and he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must
    try to remember it and put it down:&mdash;</p>
