    <p>When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when
    abroad, and gave me a typewritten copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker&rsquo;s diary at Whitby. &ldquo;Take these,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
    study them well. When I have returned you will be master of all the facts, and we can then better enter on our
    inquisition. Keep them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your faith, even you who have
    had such an experience as that of to-day. What is here told,&rdquo; he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of
    papers as he spoke, &ldquo;may be the beginning of the end to you and me and many another; or it may sound the knell of
    the Un-Dead who walk the earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in any way to the story
    here told do so, for it is all-important. You have kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes!
    Then we shall go through all these together when we meet.&rdquo; He then made ready for his departure, and shortly after
    drove off to Liverpool Street. I took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before the train
    came in.</p>

    <p>The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival platforms; and I was beginning to feel
    uneasy, lest I might miss my guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and, after a quick
    glance, said: &ldquo;Dr. Seward, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And you are Mrs. Harker!&rdquo; I answered at once; whereupon she held out her hand.<a name="page_205"
    id="page_205"></a></p>

    <p>&ldquo;I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped suddenly, and a quick blush
    overspread her face.</p>

    <p>The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it was a tacit answer to her own. I got her
    luggage, which included a typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had sent a wire to my
    housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.</p>

    <p>In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was
    unable to repress a shudder when we entered.</p>

    <p>She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as she had much to say. So here I am
    finishing my entry in my phonograph diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at the
    papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before me. I must get her interested in something, so
    that I may have an opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or what a task we have in
    hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here she is!</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Mina Harker&rsquo;s Journal.</em></p>

    <p><em>29 September.</em>&mdash;After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward&rsquo;s study. At the door I paused a
    moment, for I thought I heard him talking with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at
    the door, and on his calling out, &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; I entered.</p>

    <p>To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone, and on the table opposite him was what I
    knew at once from the description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much interested.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I hope I did not keep you waiting,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but I stayed at the door as I heard you talking, and thought there
    was some one with you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he replied with a smile, &ldquo;I was only entering my diary.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Your diary?&rdquo; I asked him in surprise.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I keep it in this.&rdquo; As he spoke he laid his hand on the phonograph. I felt quite excited
    over it, and blurted out:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train for speaking. Then he paused, and a
    troubled look overspread his face.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; he began awkwardly, &ldquo;I only keep my diary in it; and as it is entirely&mdash;almost
    entirely&mdash;about my cases, it may be awkward&mdash;that is, I mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, and I tried to
    help him out of his embarrassment:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died; for all that I know of her, I shall be very
    grateful. She was very, very dear to me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me. Again he paused, and I could see that he
    was trying to invent an excuse. At length he stammered out:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary.&rdquo; Even while he was speaking an idea
    dawned upon him, and he said with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naïveté of a child:
    &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!&rdquo; I could not but smile, at which he grimaced. &ldquo;I gave myself away
    that time!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months past, it never once struck me
    how I was going to find any particular part of it in case I wanted to look it up?&rdquo; By this time my mind was made up
    that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that
    terrible Being, and I said boldly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my typewriter.&rdquo; He grew to a positively deathly
    pallor as he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn&rsquo;t let you know that terrible story!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought, and as my eyes ranged the room,
    unconsciously looking for something or some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on the
    table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking, followed their direction. As they saw the parcel
    he realised my meaning.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You do not know me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;When you have read those papers&mdash;my own diary and my husband&rsquo;s also, which I
    have typed&mdash;you will know me better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in this cause;
    but, of course, you do not know me&mdash;yet; and I must not expect you to trust me so far.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about him. He stood up and opened a large drawer,
    in which were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered
    with dark wax, and said:&mdash;</p>
