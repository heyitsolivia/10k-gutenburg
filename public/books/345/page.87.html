    <p>&ldquo;So far,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;our night has been eminently successful. No harm has come to us such as I feared might be and
    yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our first&mdash;and
    perhaps our most difficult and dangerous&mdash;step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most
    sweet Madam Mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she
    might never forget. One lesson, too, we have learned, if it be allowable to argue <em>a particulari</em>: that the
    brute beasts which are to the Count&rsquo;s command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power; for look,
    these rats that would come to his call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that
    poor mother&rsquo;s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have
    other matters before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster&mdash;he has not used his power over the brute
    world for the only or the last time to-night. So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity
    to cry â€˜check&rsquo; in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the stake of human souls. And now let us go home.
    The dawn is close at hand, and we have reason to be content with our first night&rsquo;s work. It may be ordained that we
    have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril; but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant
    wards, and a low, moaning sound from Renfield&rsquo;s room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself, after the
    manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.</p>

    <p>I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so softly that I had to put my ear down to hear
    it. She looks paler than usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her.
    I am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our deliberations. It is too great a
    strain for a woman to bear. I did not think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is
    settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than
    to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her,
    till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether
    world. I daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours; but I must be
    resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep dark over to-night&rsquo;s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that has
    happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.</p>

    
    <p><em>1 October, later.</em>&mdash;I suppose it was natural that we should have all overslept ourselves, for the day
    was a busy one, and the night had no rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept till
    the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so
    sound asleep that for a few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of blank terror, as one
    looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later
    in the day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be that several were taken in any of
    these removals we may be able to trace them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the sooner
    the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas Snelling to-day.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>1 October.</em>&mdash;It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor walking into my room. He was
    more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it is quite evident that last night&rsquo;s work has helped to take some of the
    brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him this morning? Or if that you are too occupy,
    I can go alone if it may be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy, and reason so
    sound.&rdquo; I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I
    should not have to keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions. Before the
    Professor left the room I cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I
    want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your
    diary of yesterday, that he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but the answer is here.&rdquo; I laid my hand on the type-written matter. &ldquo;When our sane and
    learned lunatic made that very statement of how he <em>used</em> to consume life, his mouth was actually nauseous with
    the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs. Harker entered the room.&rdquo; Van Helsing smiled in turn.
    &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it is this very obliquity of
    thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the
    folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise. Who knows?&rdquo; I went on with my work, and before
    long was through that in hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing back in
    the study. &ldquo;Do I interrupt?&rdquo; he asked politely as he stood at the door.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Come in. My work is finished, and I am free. I can go with you now, if you like.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It is needless; I have seen him!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short. When I entered his room he was sitting on
    a stool in the centre, with his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen discontent. I spoke to
    him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever.
    &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; I asked. His answer was not reassuring: &ldquo;I know you well enough; you are the old fool Van
    Helsing. I wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed
    Dutchmen!&rdquo; Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had
    not been in the room at all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic; so
    I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does
    rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be worried with our terrible things. Though we
    shall much miss her help, it is better so.&rdquo;</p>
