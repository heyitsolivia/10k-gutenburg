    <p>This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron excepted from the category, jealousy.</p>

      <div class="stanza"><span class="i0">&ldquo;And prove the very truth he most abhorred.&rdquo;</span></div>
    </div>
    <p class="nind">He saw my hesitation, and spoke:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The logic is simple, no madman&rsquo;s logic this time, jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not
    true, then proof will be relief; at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet very dread
    should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come, I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now
    and see that child in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers say the child is, is friend
    of mine, and I think of yours since you were in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he
    will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we wish to learn. And then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; He took a key from his pocket and held it up. &ldquo;And then we spend the night, you and I, in the
    churchyard where Lucy lies. This is the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to Arthur.&rdquo; My
    heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I
    plucked up what heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was passing....</p>

    <p>We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent
    took the bandage from its throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the similarity to those which
    had been on Lucy&rsquo;s throat. They were smaller, and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what
    he attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own
    part, he was inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of London.
    &ldquo;Out of so many harmless ones,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there may be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant
    species. Some sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from the Zoölogical Gardens a
    young one may have got loose, or one be bred there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days
    ago a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a week after, the children were playing
    nothing but Red Riding Hood on the Heath and in every alley in the place until this ‘bloofer lady&rsquo; scare came along,
    since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the
    nurse if he might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted to play with the ‘bloofer
    lady.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Van Helsing, &ldquo;that when you are sending the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict
    watch over it. These fancies to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another night, it
    would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will not let it away for some days?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not healed.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before we came out. When
    Van Helsing saw how dark it was, he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek somewhere that we may eat, and then we
    shall go on our way.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>We dined at &ldquo;Jack Straw&rsquo;s Castle&rdquo; along with a little crowd of bicyclists
    and others who were genially noisy. About ten o&rsquo;clock we started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the
    scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius. The Professor had
    evidently noted the road we were to go, for he went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to
    locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met
    even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of the churchyard,
    which we climbed over. With some little difficulty&mdash;for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange
    to us&mdash;we found the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door, and standing back,
    politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the
    courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew
    the door to, after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring, one. In the latter case we
    should have been in a bad plight. Then he fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,
    proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed with fresh flowers, had looked grim and
    gruesome enough; but now, some days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites turning to rust
    and their greens to browns; when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when
    time-discoloured stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished brass, and clouded
    silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have
    been imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life&mdash;animal life&mdash;was not the only thing which
    could pass away.</p>

    <p>Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and
    so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he made assurance
    of Lucy&rsquo;s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took out a turnscrew.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.&rdquo; Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted
    off the lid, showing the casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed to be as much an
    affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually
    took hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: &ldquo;You shall see,&rdquo; and again
    fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab,
    which made me wince, he made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of the saw. I had
    expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become
    accustomed to such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never stopped for a moment; he sawed
    down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the edge
    of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture,
    motioned to me to look.</p>
