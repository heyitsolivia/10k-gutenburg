    <p>&ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take care how you cut yourself. It is more dangerous than you think in this country.&rdquo; Then
    seizing the shaving glass, he went on: &ldquo;And this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief. It is a foul
    bauble of man&rsquo;s vanity. Away with it!&rdquo; and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung
    out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very annoying, for I do not see how I am
    to shave, unless in my watch-case or the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.</p>

    <p>When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could not find the Count anywhere. So I
    breakfasted alone. It is strange that as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very peculiar man!
    After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I went out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards
    the South. The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity of seeing it. The castle is
    on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without
    touching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where
    there is a chasm. Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests.</p>

    <p>But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I explored further; doors, doors, doors
    everywhere, and all locked and bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available
    exit.</p>

    <p>The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!</p>

    <p class="nind">W<small>HEN</small> I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me. I rushed up
    and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of every window I could find; but after a little the
    conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a few hours I think I must have
    been mad for the time, for I behaved much as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me that
    I was helpless I sat down quietly&mdash;as quietly as I have ever done anything in my life&mdash;and began to think
    over what was best to be done. I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of one thing
    only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to the Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as
    he has done it himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive me if I trusted him fully
    with the facts. So far as I can see, my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes
    open. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears, or else I am in desperate straits; and if
    the latter be so, I need, and shall need, all my brains to get through.</p>

    <p>I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below shut, and knew that the Count had
    returned. He did not come at once into the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making the
    bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along thought&mdash;that there were no servants in the house.
    When later I saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining-room, I was assured
    of it; for if he does himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.
    This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it must have been the Count himself who was the
    driver of the coach that brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it mean that he could
    control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz
    and on the coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild
    rose, of the mountain ash? Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix
    round my neck! for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing which I have
    been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it
    that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying
    memories of sympathy and comfort? Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind
    about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night
    he may talk of himself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful, however, not to awake his
    suspicion.</p>

    
    <p><em>Midnight.</em>&mdash;I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few questions on Transylvania
    history, and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of
    battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he afterwards explained by saying that to a
    <em>boyar</em> the pride of his house and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their fate is his
    fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said &ldquo;we,&rdquo; and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I
    wish I could put down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most fascinating. It seemed to have in it
    a whole history of the country. He grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great white
    moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength. One thing
    he said which I shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of his race:&mdash;</p>
