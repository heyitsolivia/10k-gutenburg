    <p>&ldquo;‘My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved. That is much, my dear,
    ever were there that which I do not see. They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a ghastly
    pale. To them I say: &ldquo;Pouf!&rdquo;&rsquo; And he snapped his fingers at me and went on: ‘But you and I shall show them how
    wrong they are. How can he&rsquo;&mdash;and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which once he
    pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me
    of&mdash;‘know anything of a young ladies? He has his madams to play with, and to bring them back to happiness, and
    to those that love them. It is much to do, and, oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But
    the young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell themselves to the young, but to the old,
    like me, who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to smoke the
    cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all to ourselves.&rsquo; I took the hint, and strolled about,
    and presently the professor came to the window and called me in. He looked grave, but said: ‘I have made careful examination, but there is no functional cause. With you I agree that there has
    been much blood lost; it has been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anæmic. I have asked her to
    send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question, that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well
    what she will say. And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go back home and think. You
    must send to me the telegram every day; and if there be cause I shall come again. The disease&mdash;for not to be
    all well is a disease&mdash;interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me too. She charm me, and for her,
    if not for you or disease, I come.&rsquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone. And so now, Art, you know all I know. I
    shall keep stern watch. I trust your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my dear old
    fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to
    your father, and you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to come at once to Lucy; so do
    not be over-anxious unless you hear from me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>4 September.</em>&mdash;Zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him. He had only one outburst and
    that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew
    the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke
    of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five minutes, however, he began
    to get more and more quiet, and finally sank into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now.
    The attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling; I found my hands full when I
    got in, attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite understand the
    effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the
    asylum, and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen, woe-begone look in his face, which
    seems rather to indicate than to show something directly. I cannot quite understand it.</p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;Another change in my patient. At five o&rsquo;clock I looked in on him, and found him seemingly as
    happy and contented as he used to be. He was catching flies and eating them, and was<a name="page_109"
    id="page_109"></a> keeping note of his capture by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of
    padding. When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad conduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing
    way to be led back to his own room and to have his note-book again. I thought it well to humour him: so he is back
    in his room with the window open. He has the sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a
    harvest of flies. He is not now eating them, but putting them into a box, as of old, and is already examining the
    corners of his room to find a spider. I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any clue to his
    thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not rise. For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in
    a sort of far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;All over! all over! He has deserted me. No hope for me now unless I do it for myself!&rdquo; Then suddenly turning to
    me in a resolute way, he said: &ldquo;Doctor, won&rsquo;t you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar? I think it
    would be good for me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And the flies?&rdquo; I said.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes! The flies like it, too, and I like the flies; therefore I like it.&rdquo; And there are people who know so little
    as to think that madmen do not argue. I procured him a double supply, and left him as happy a man as, I suppose, any
    in the world. I wish I could fathom his mind.</p>

    
    <p><em>Midnight.</em>&mdash;Another change in him. I had been to see Miss Westenra, whom I found much better, and had
    just returned, and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset, when once more I heard him yelling. As his
    room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than in the morning. It was a shock to me to turn from the
    wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints
    that come on foul clouds even as on foul water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building,
    with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart to endure it all. I reached him just as the sun was
    going down, and from his window saw the red disc sink. As it sank he became less and less frenzied; and just as it
    dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an inert mass, on the floor. It is wonderful, however, what
    intellectual recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around
    him. I signalled to the attendants not to hold him, for I was anxious to see
    what he would do. He went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his fly-box,
    and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All
    this surprised me, so I asked him: &ldquo;Are you not going to keep flies any more?&rdquo;</p>
