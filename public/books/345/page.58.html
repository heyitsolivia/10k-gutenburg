    <p>He was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part&mdash;in which he was officially
    interested&mdash;of so great a tragedy, was an object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.</p>

    <p>He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and see Lord Godalming. His coming, however,
    had been a certain comfort to us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any
    of our acts. Arthur was expected at five o&rsquo;clock, so a little before that time we visited the death-chamber. It was
    so in very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. The undertaker, true to his craft, had made the best
    display he could of his goods, and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once. Van
    Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to, explaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it
    would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his <em>fiancée</em> quite alone. The undertaker
    seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them the
    night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings as we could
    avoid were saved.</p>

    <p>Poor fellow! He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under
    the strain of his much-tried emotions. He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father; and
    to lose him, and at such a time, was a bitter blow to him. With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he was
    sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him. The Professor noticed it,
    too, and motioned me to bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I felt he would like
    to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and led me in, saying huskily:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was no friend had a closer place in her heart
    than you. I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you for all you have done for her. I can&rsquo;t think yet....&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Here he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and laid his head on my breast,
    crying:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack! Jack! What shall I do! The whole of life seems gone from me all at once, and there is nothing in the
    wide world for me to live for.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much expression. A grip of the hand, the
    tightening of an arm over the shoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man&rsquo;s heart. I stood
    still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said softly to him:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Come and look at her.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Together we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face. God! how beautiful she was. Every hour
    seemed to be enhancing her loveliness. It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he fell a-trembling,
    and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint
    whisper:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Jack, is she really dead?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest&mdash;for I felt that such a horrible doubt should not
    have life for a moment longer than I could help&mdash;that it often happened that after death faces became softened
    and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute
    or prolonged suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after kneeling beside the couch for a while
    and looking at her lovingly and long, he turned aside. I told him that that
    must be good-bye, as the coffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it, and
    bent over and kissed her forehead. He came away, fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.</p>

    <p>I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen
    to tell the undertaker&rsquo;s men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he came out of the
    room again I told him of Arthur&rsquo;s question, and he replied:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>We all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make the best of things. Van Helsing had been
    silent all dinner-time; but when we had lit our cigars he said&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Lord&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;; but Arthur interrupted him:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, no, not that, for God&rsquo;s sake! not yet at any rate. Forgive me, sir: I did not mean to speak offensively; it
    is only because my loss is so recent.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Professor answered very sweetly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I only used that name because I was in doubt. I must not call you ‘Mr.,&rsquo; and I have grown to love you&mdash;yes,
    my dear boy, to love you&mdash;as Arthur.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Arthur held out his hand, and took the old man&rsquo;s warmly.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Call me what you will,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope I may always have the title of a friend. And let me say that I am at a
    loss for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear.&rdquo; He paused a moment, and went on: &ldquo;I know that she
    understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted
    so&mdash;you remember&rdquo;&mdash;the Professor nodded&mdash;&ldquo;you must forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He answered with a grave kindness:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such violence needs to understand; and I take it
    that you do not&mdash;that you cannot&mdash;trust me now, for you do not yet understand. And there may be more times
    when I shall want you to trust when you cannot&mdash;and may not&mdash;and must not yet understand. But the time
    will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as though the sunlight
    himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and
    for her dear sake to whom I swore to protect.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And, indeed, indeed, sir,&rdquo; said Arthur warmly, &ldquo;I shall in all ways trust you. I know and believe you have a
    very noble heart, and you are Jack&rsquo;s friend, and you were hers. You shall do
    what you like.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to speak, and finally said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;May I ask you something now?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You know that Mrs. Westenra left you all her property?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, poor dear; I never thought of it.&rdquo;</p>
