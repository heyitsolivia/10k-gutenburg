    <p>&ldquo;‘Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here speaking to you as I am now if I did
    not believe you clean grit, right through to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow to another,
    is there any one else that you care for? And if there is I&rsquo;ll never trouble you a hair&rsquo;s breadth again, but will be,
    if you will let me, a very faithful friend.&rsquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them? Here was I almost making fun of
    this great-hearted, true gentleman. I burst into tears&mdash;I am afraid, my
    dear, you will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one&mdash;and I really felt very badly. Why can&rsquo;t
    they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must
    not say it. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into Mr. Morris&rsquo;s brave eyes, and I told
    him out straight:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;‘Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he even loves me.&rsquo; I was right to speak
    to him so frankly, for quite a light came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine&mdash;I think I
    put them into his&mdash;and said in a hearty way:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;‘That&rsquo;s my brave girl. It&rsquo;s better worth being late for a chance of winning you than being in time for any
    other girl in the world. Don&rsquo;t cry, my dear. If it&rsquo;s for me, I&rsquo;m a hard nut to crack; and I take it standing up. If
    that other fellow doesn&rsquo;t know his happiness, well, he&rsquo;d better look for it soon, or he&rsquo;ll have to deal with me.
    Little girl, your honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that&rsquo;s rarer than a lover; it&rsquo;s more unselfish
    anyhow. My dear, I&rsquo;m going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won&rsquo;t you give me one kiss?
    It&rsquo;ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you know, if you like, for that other good
    fellow&mdash;he must be a good fellow, my dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t spoken
    yet.&rsquo; That quite won me, Mina, for it <em>was</em> brave and sweet of him, and noble, too, to a rival&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t
    it?&mdash;and he so sad; so I leant over and kissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down
    into my face&mdash;I am afraid I was blushing very much&mdash;he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;‘Little girl, I hold your hand, and you&rsquo;ve kissed me, and if these things don&rsquo;t make us friends nothing
    ever will. Thank you for your sweet honesty to me, and good-bye.&rsquo; He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat, went
    straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby.
    Oh, why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he
    trod on? I know I would if I were free&mdash;only I don&rsquo;t want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel
    I cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I don&rsquo;t wish to tell of the number three
    until it can be all happy.</p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;Ever your loving&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lucy.</span></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Oh, about number Three&mdash;I needn&rsquo;t tell you of number Three, need I? Besides, it was all so
    confused; it seemed only a moment from his coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was kissing
    me. I am very, very happy, and I don&rsquo;t know what I have done to deserve it. I must only try in the future to show
    that I am not ungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a lover, such a husband, and such a
    friend.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p class="c">(Kept in phonograph)</p>

    <p><em>25 May.</em>&mdash;Ebb tide in appetite to-day. Cannot eat, cannot rest, so diary instead. Since my rebuff of
    yesterday I have a sort of empty feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the
    doing.... As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was work, I went down amongst the patients. I picked
    out one who has afforded me a study of much interest. He is so quaint that I am determined to understand him as well
    as I can. To-day I seemed to get nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.</p>

    <p>I questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making myself master of the facts of his
    hallucination. In my manner of doing it there was, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep him to
    the point of his madness&mdash;a thing which I avoid with the patients as I would the mouth of hell.</p>

    <p>(<em>Mem.</em>, under what circumstances would I <em>not</em> avoid the pit of hell?) <em>Omnia Romæ venalia sunt.</em>
    Hell has its price! <em>verb. sap.</em> If there be anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it
    afterwards <em>accurately</em>, so I had better commence to do so, therefore&mdash;</p>

    <p>R. M. Renfield, ætat 59.&mdash;Sanguine temperament; great physical strength; morbidly excitable; periods of
    gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I cannot make out. I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the
    disturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish; a possibly dangerous man, probably dangerous if
    unselfish. In selfish men caution is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think of on this
    point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause,
    etc., is the fixed point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a
    series of accidents can balance it.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Letter, Quincey P. Morris to Hon. Arthur Holmwood.</em></p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;<em>25 May.</em></p>

    <p class="nind">&ldquo;My dear Art,&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve told yarns by the camp-fire in the prairies; and dressed one another&rsquo;s wounds after trying a landing at
    the Marquesas; and drunk healths on the shore of Titicaca. There are more yarns to be told, and other wounds to be
    healed, and another health to be drunk. Won&rsquo;t you let this be at my camp-fire to-morrow night? I have no hesitation
    in asking you, as I know a certain lady is engaged to a certain dinner-party, and that you are free. There will only
    be one other, our old pal at the Korea, Jack Seward. He&rsquo;s coming, too, and we both want to mingle our weeps over the
    wine-cup, and to drink a health with all our hearts to the happiest man in all the wide world, who has won the
    noblest heart that God has made and the best worth winning. We promise you a hearty welcome, and a loving greeting,
    and a health as true as your own right hand. We shall both swear to leave you at home if you drink too deep to a
    certain pair of eyes. Come!</p>
