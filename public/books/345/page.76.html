    <p>&ldquo;You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you. But I know you now; and let me say that I
    should have known you long ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make the only
    atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them&mdash;the first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and
    they will not horrify you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the meantime I shall read
    over some of these documents, and shall be better able to understand certain things.&rdquo; He carried the phonograph
    himself up to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something pleasant, I am sure; for it will
    tell me the other side of a true love episode of which I know one side already....</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Dr. Seward&rsquo;s Diary.</em></p>

    <p><em>29 September.</em>&mdash;I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan Harker and that other of his
    wife that I let the time run on without thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner, so
    I said: &ldquo;She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,&rdquo; and I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs.
    Harker&rsquo;s diary, when she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were flushed with crying.
    This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and
    now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I
    could:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I greatly fear I have distressed you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not distressed me,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I have been more touched than I can say by your grief. That is a
    wonderful machine, but it is cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart. It was like a
    soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have
    copied out the words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as I did.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No one need ever know, shall ever know,&rdquo; I said in a low voice. She laid her hand on mine and said very
    gravely:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ah, but they must!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Must! But why?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy&rsquo;s death and all that led to it; because in
    the struggle which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we<a name="page_208"
    id="page_208"></a> must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the cylinders which
    you gave me contained more than you intended me to know; but I can see that there are in your record many lights to
    this dark mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain point; and I see already, though
    your diary only took me to 7 September, how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought out.
    Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more
    information, and he will be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us; working together and with
    absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark.&rdquo; She looked at me so appealingly, and
    at the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing, that I gave in at once to her wishes. &ldquo;You
    shall,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;do as you like in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible things yet to learn
    of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to poor Lucy&rsquo;s death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in
    the dark. Nay, the end&mdash;the very end&mdash;may give you a gleam of peace. Come, there is dinner. We must keep
    one another strong for what is before us; we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn the
    rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask&mdash;if there be anything which you do not understand, though it was
    apparent to us who were present.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Mina Harker&rsquo;s Journal.</em></p>

    <p><em>29 September.</em>&mdash;After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He brought back the phonograph from
    my room, and I took my typewriter. He placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I could
    touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully
    took a chair, with his back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I put the forked metal
    to my ears and listened.</p>

    <p>When the terrible story of Lucy&rsquo;s death, and&mdash;and all that followed, was done, I lay back in my chair
    powerless. Fortunately I am not of a fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified
    exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes
    somewhat restored me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors,
    the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy was at last at peace, I do not
    think I could have borne it without making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I had not
    known Jonathan&rsquo;s experience in Transylvania I could not have believed. As it was, I didn&rsquo;t know what to believe, and
    so got out of my difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my typewriter, and said to Dr.
    Seward:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing when he comes. I have sent a telegram to
    Jonathan to come on here when he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything, and I think
    that if we get all our material ready, and have every item put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You
    tell me that Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him when they come.&rdquo; He
    accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder.
    I used manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with all the rest. It was late when I got
    through, but Dr. Seward went about his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he came back
    and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the
    world seems full of good men&mdash;even if there <em>are</em> monsters in it. Before I left him I remembered what
    Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor&rsquo;s perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at
    Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the files of &ldquo;The Westminster Gazette&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
    Pall Mall Gazette,&rdquo; and took them to my room. I remember how much &ldquo;The Dailygraph&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Whitby Gazette,&rdquo; of
    which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I
    shall look through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new light. I am not sleepy, and the
    work will help to keep me quiet.</p>
