    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;Glad I made the resolution; gladder that I kept to it. I had lain tossing about, and had
    heard the clock strike only twice, when the night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that Renfield
    had escaped. I threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about.
    Those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers. The attendant was
    waiting for me. He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his bed, when he had looked
    through the observation-trap in the door. His attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. He
    ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once sent up for me. He was only in his
    night-gear, and cannot be far off. The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to
    follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door. He is a bulky man, and
    couldn&rsquo;t get through the window. I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet foremost, and, as we were only a
    few feet above ground, landed unhurt. The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a
    straight line, so I ran as quickly as I could. As I got through the belt of trees I saw a white figure scale the
    high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house.</p>

    <p>I ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and follow me into the grounds of
    Carfax, in case our friend might be dangerous. I got a ladder myself, and crossing the wall, dropped down on the
    other side. I could see Renfield&rsquo;s figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him. On
    the far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel. He was
    talking, apparently to some one, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest I might
    frighten him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic, when
    the fit of escaping is upon him! After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not take note of anything
    around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to him&mdash;the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were
    closing him in. I heard him say:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am here to do Your bidding, Master. I am Your slave, and You will reward me, for I shall be faithful. I have
    worshipped You long and afar off. Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass me by, will
    You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He <em>is</em> a selfish old beggar anyhow. He thinks of the loaves and fishes even when he believes he is in a
    Real Presence. His manias make a startling combination. When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger. He is
    immensely strong, for he was more like a wild beast than a man. I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage
    before; and I hope I shall not again. It is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time.
    With strength and determination like his, he might have done wild work before
    he was caged. He is safe now at any rate. Jack Sheppard himself couldn&rsquo;t get free from the strait-waistcoat that
    keeps him restrained, and he&rsquo;s chained to the wall in the padded room. His cries are at times awful, but the
    silences that follow are more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.</p>

    <p>Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I shall be patient, Master. It is coming&mdash;coming&mdash;coming!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So I took the hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall
    get some sleep to-night.</p>

    <p class="letra"><em>Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra.</em></p>

    <p class="r">&ldquo;<em>Buda-Pesth, 24 August.</em></p>

    <p class="nind">&ldquo;My dearest Lucy,&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we parted at the railway station at Whitby. Well,
    my dear, I got to Hull all right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here. I feel that I can
    hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I knew I was coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do
    some nursing, I had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one, oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking.
    All the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his face has
    vanished. He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time
    past. At least, he wants me to believe so, and I shall never ask. He has had some terrible shock, and I fear it
    might tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it. Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,
    tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head. I wanted her to tell me what they were; but
    she would only cross herself, and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the secrets of God,
    and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them, she should respect her trust. She is a sweet, good soul,
    and the next day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again, and after saying that she could
    never mention what my poor dear raved about, added: â€˜I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about
    anything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be, have no cause to be concerned. He has not
    forgotten you or what he owes to you. His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can treat of.&rsquo; I do
    believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl.
    The idea of <em>my</em> being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I felt a thrill of joy through
    me when I <em>knew</em> that no other woman was a cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see
    his face while he sleeps. He is waking!...</p>

    <p>&ldquo;When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and
    she brought all his things. I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to let me look at
    it&mdash;for I knew then that I might find some clue to his trouble&mdash;but I suppose he must have seen my wish in
    my eyes, for he sent me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment. Then he called me back,
    and when I came he had his hand over the note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:&mdash;</p>
