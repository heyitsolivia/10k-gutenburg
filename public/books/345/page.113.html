    <p>&ldquo;In the morning we shall leave for Varna. We have now to deal with a new
    factor: Madam Mina. Oh, but her soul is true. It is to her an agony to tell us so much as she has done; but it is
    most right, and we are warned in time. There must be no chance lost, and in Varna we must be ready to act the
    instant when that ship arrives.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What shall we do exactly?&rdquo; asked Mr. Morris laconically. The Professor paused before replying:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified the box, we shall place a branch of the
    wild rose on it. This we shall fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the superstition. And
    to superstition must we trust at the first; it was man&rsquo;s faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still.
    Then, when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we shall open the box, and&mdash;and all
    will be well.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I shall not wait for any opportunity,&rdquo; said Morris. &ldquo;When I see the box I shall open it and destroy the monster,
    though there were a thousand men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!&rdquo; I grasped his hand
    instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel. I think he understood my look; I hope he did.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; said Dr. Van Helsing. &ldquo;Brave boy. Quincey is all man. God bless him for it. My child, believe me none
    of us shall lag behind or pause from any fear. I do but say what we may do&mdash;what we must do. But, indeed,
    indeed we cannot say what we shall do. There are so many things which may happen, and their ways and their ends are
    so various that until the moment we may not say. We shall all be armed, in all ways; and when the time for the end
    has come, our effort shall not be lack. Now let us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch
    on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us can tell what, or when, or how, the end may
    be. As for me, my own affairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make arrangements for the
    travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for our journey.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now settle up all my affairs of earth, and be ready
    for whatever may come....</p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;It is all done; my will is made, and all complete. Mina if she survive is my sole heir. If it
    should not be so, then the others who have been so good to us shall have remainder.</p>

    <p>It is now drawing towards the sunset; Mina&rsquo;s uneasiness calls my attention
    to it. I am sure that there is something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal. These occasions are
    becoming harrowing times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new danger&mdash;some new pain,
    which, however, may in God&rsquo;s will be means to a good end. I write all these things in the diary since my darling
    must not hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they shall be ready.</p>

    <p>She is calling to me.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV<small>DR. SEWARD&rsquo;S DIARY</small></h2>
    <p><em>11 October, Evening.</em>&mdash;Jonathan Harker has asked me to note this, as he says he is hardly equal to the
    task, and he wants an exact record kept.</p>

    <p>I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset.
    We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom; when her old self
    can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or
    condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or
    whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of negative
    condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom
    ceases the change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence.</p>

    <p>To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the signs of an internal struggle. I put it
    down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. A very few minutes, however,
    gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half
    reclining, she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. Taking her husband&rsquo;s hand in hers began:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! I know, dear; I know that you will always be
    with me to the end.&rdquo; This was to her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. &ldquo;In the morning
    we go out upon our task, and God alone knows what may be in store for any of us. You are going to be so good to me
    as to take me with you. I know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman, whose soul perhaps is
    lost&mdash;no, no, not yet, but is at any rate at stake&mdash;you will do. But you must remember that I am not as
    you are. There is a poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which must destroy me, unless some relief
    comes to us. Oh, my friends, you know as well as I do, that my soul is at stake; and though I know there is one way
    out for me, you must not and I must not take it!&rdquo; She looked appealingly to us
    all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What is that way?&rdquo; asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice. &ldquo;What is that way, which we must not&mdash;may
    not&mdash;take?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That I may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before the greater evil is entirely wrought. I
    know, and you know, that were I once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you did my poor
    Lucy&rsquo;s. Were death, or the fear of death, the only thing that stood in the way I would not shrink to die here, now,
    amidst the friends who love me. But death is not all. I cannot believe that to die in such a case, when there is
    hope before us and a bitter task to be done, is God&rsquo;s will. Therefore, I, on my part, give up here the certainty of
    eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!&rdquo;
    We were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude. The faces of the others were set and
    Harker&rsquo;s grew ashen grey; perhaps he guessed better than any of us what was coming. She continued:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;This is what I can give into the hotch-pot.&rdquo; I could not but note the quaint legal phrase which she used in such
    a place, and with all seriousness. &ldquo;What will each of you give? Your lives I know,&rdquo; she went on quickly, &ldquo;that is
    easy for brave men. Your lives are God&rsquo;s, and you can give them back to Him; but what will you give to me?&rdquo; She
    looked again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband&rsquo;s face. Quincey seemed to understand; he nodded, and
    her face lit up. &ldquo;Then I shall tell you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection
    between us now. You must promise me, one and all&mdash;even you, my beloved husband&mdash;that, should the time
    come, you will kill me.&rdquo;</p>
