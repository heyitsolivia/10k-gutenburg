    <p>&ldquo;I have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all the papers relating to this monster; and
    the more I have studied, the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there are signs of
    his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of it. As I learned from the researches of my friend
    Arminus of Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and alchemist&mdash;which latter was
    the highest development of the science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond compare, and
    a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of
    knowledge of his time that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the physical death; though it
    would seem that memory was not all complete. In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is
    growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of man&rsquo;s stature. He is experimenting, and doing it
    well; and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yet&mdash;he may be yet if we fail&mdash;the
    father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must lead through
    Death, not Life.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Harker groaned and said, &ldquo;And this is all arrayed against my darling! But how is he experimenting? The knowledge
    may help us to defeat him!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but surely; that big child-brain of his is
    working. Well for us, it is, as yet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain things he
    would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can
    afford to wait and to go slow. <em>Festina lente</em> may well be his motto.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I fail to understand,&rdquo; said Harker wearily. &ldquo;Oh, do be more plain to me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling
    my brain.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ah, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this monster has been creeping into knowledge
    experimentally. How he has been making use of the zo√∂phagous patient to effect his entry into friend John&rsquo;s home;
    for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will, must at the first make entry only when
    asked thereto by an inmate. But these are not his most important experiments. Do we not see how at the first all
    these so great boxes were moved by others. He knew not then but that must be so. But all the time that so great
    child-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box. So he began to
    help; and then, when he found that this be all-right, he try to move them all alone. And so he progress, and he
    scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where they are hidden. He may have intend to bury them deep in the
    ground. So that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change his form, they do him equal well;
    and none may know these are his hiding-place! But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him just too
    late! Already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him; and before the sunset this shall be so. Then he have
    no place where he can move and hide. I delayed this morning that so we might be sure. Is there not more at stake for
    us than for him? Then why we not be even more careful than him? By my clock it is one hour and already, if all be
    well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us. To-day is our day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no
    chance. See! there are five of us when those absent ones return.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door, the double postman&rsquo;s knock of the telegraph
    boy. We all moved out to the hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us to keep silence,
    stepped to the door and opened it. The boy handed in a despatch. The Professor closed the door again, and, after
    looking at the direction, opened it and read aloud.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Look out for D. He has just now, 12:45, come from Carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the South. He seems to
    be going the round and may want to see you: Mina.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker&rsquo;s voice:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Now, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!&rdquo; Van Helsing turned to him quickly and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;God will act in His own way and time. Do not fear, and do not rejoice as yet; for what we wish for at the moment
    may be our undoings.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I care for nothing now,&rdquo; he answered hotly, &ldquo;except to wipe out this brute from the face of creation. I would
    sell my soul to do it!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, hush, hush, my child!&rdquo; said Van Helsing. &ldquo;God does not purchase souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he
    may purchase, does not keep faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear
    Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be doubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we
    are all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is coming for action; to-day this Vampire is
    limit to the powers of man, and till sunset he may not change. It will take him time to arrive here&mdash;see, it is
    twenty minutes past one&mdash;and there are yet some times before he can hither come, be he never so quick. What we
    must hope for is that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>About half an hour after we had received Mrs. Harker&rsquo;s telegram, there came a quiet, resolute knock at the hall
    door. It was just an ordinary knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made the Professor&rsquo;s
    heart and mine beat loudly. We looked at each other, and together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use
    our various armaments&mdash;the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. Van Helsing pulled back the
    latch, and, holding the door half open, stood back, having both hands ready for action. The gladness of our hearts
    must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we saw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris. They
    came quickly in and closed the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the hall:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It is all right. We found both places; six boxes in each and we destroyed them all!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Destroyed?&rdquo; asked the Professor.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;For him!&rdquo; We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to do but to wait here. If, however, he doesn&rsquo;t turn up by five o&rsquo;clock, we must start off; for
    it won&rsquo;t do to leave Mrs. Harker alone after sunset.&rdquo;</p>
