    <p>&ldquo;‘Ow yes, they would,&rsquo; says I, a-imitatin&rsquo; of him. ‘They always likes a bone or two to clean their teeth on
    about tea-time, which you &rsquo;as a bagful.&rsquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin&rsquo; they lay down, and when I went over to
    Bersicker he let me stroke his ears same as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn&rsquo;t put in his
    hand and stroke the old wolf&rsquo;s ears too!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;‘Tyke care,&rsquo; says I. ‘Bersicker is quick.&rsquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;‘Never mind,&rsquo; he says. ‘I&rsquo;m used to &rsquo;em!&rsquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;‘Are you in the business yourself?&rsquo; I says, tyking off my &rsquo;at, for a man what trades in wolves, anceterer,
    is a good friend to keepers.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;‘No&rsquo; says he, ‘not exactly in the business, but I &rsquo;ave made pets of several.&rsquo; And with that he lifts his
    &rsquo;at as perlite as a lord, and walks away. Old Bersicker kep&rsquo; a-lookin&rsquo; arter &rsquo;im till &rsquo;e was out of sight, and then
    went and lay down in a corner and wouldn&rsquo;t come hout the &rsquo;ole hevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was
    hup, the wolves here all began a-&rsquo;owling. There warn&rsquo;t nothing for them to &rsquo;owl at. There warn&rsquo;t no one near, except
    some one that was evidently a-callin&rsquo; a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice I
    went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the &rsquo;owling stopped. Just before twelve o&rsquo;clock I just took
    a look round afore turnin&rsquo; in, an&rsquo;, bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker&rsquo;s cage I see the rails broken
    and twisted about and the cage empty. And that&rsquo;s all I know for certing.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Did any one else see anything?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;One of our gard&rsquo;ners was a-comin&rsquo; &rsquo;ome about that time from a &rsquo;armony, when he sees a big grey dog comin&rsquo; out
    through the garding &rsquo;edges. At least, so he says, but I don&rsquo;t give much for it myself, for if he did &rsquo;e never said a
    word about it to his missis when &rsquo;e got &rsquo;ome, and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we
    had been up all night-a-huntin&rsquo; of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein&rsquo; anything. My own belief was
    that the &rsquo;armony &rsquo;ad got into his &rsquo;ead.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the wolf?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, &ldquo;I think I can; but I don&rsquo;t know as &rsquo;ow you&rsquo;d be
    satisfied with the theory.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from experience, can&rsquo;t hazard a good guess at any
    rate, who is even to try?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that &rsquo;ere wolf escaped&mdash;simply because he wanted
    to get out.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>From the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I could see that it had done service
    before, and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn&rsquo;t cope in badinage with the worthy
    Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart, so I said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Bilder, we&rsquo;ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off, and this brother of his is waiting to be
    claimed when you&rsquo;ve told me what you think will happen.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Right y&rsquo;are, sir,&rdquo; he said briskly. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll excoose me, I know, for a-chaffin&rsquo; of ye, but the old woman here
    winked at me, which was as much as telling me to go on.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; said the old lady.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My opinion is this: that &rsquo;ere wolf is a-&rsquo;idin&rsquo; of, somewheres. The gard&rsquo;ner wot didn&rsquo;t remember said he was
    a-gallopin&rsquo; northward faster than a horse could go; but I don&rsquo;t believe him, for, yer see, sir, wolves don&rsquo;t gallop
    no more nor dogs does, they not bein&rsquo; built that way. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they
    gets in packs and does be chivyin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s more afeared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and
    chop it up, whatever it is. But, Lor&rsquo; bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so clever or
    bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in &rsquo;im. This one ain&rsquo;t been used to fightin&rsquo; or even to
    providin&rsquo; for hisself, and more like he&rsquo;s somewhere round the Park a-&rsquo;idin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-shiverin&rsquo; of, and, if he thinks at
    all, wonderin&rsquo; where he is to get his breakfast from; or maybe he&rsquo;s got down some area and is in a coal-cellar. My
    eye, won&rsquo;t some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can&rsquo;t get
    food he&rsquo;s bound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher&rsquo;s shop in time. If he doesn&rsquo;t, and
    some nursemaid goes a-walkin&rsquo; orf with a soldier, leavin&rsquo; of the hinfant in the perambulator&mdash;well, then I
    shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up against the window, and Mr. Bilder&rsquo;s face
    doubled its natural length with surprise.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;God bless me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If there ain&rsquo;t old Bersicker come back by &rsquo;isself!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it seemed to me. I have always thought that a
    wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a personal experience
    has intensified rather than diminished that idea.</p>

    <p>After all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor his wife thought any more of the wolf
    than I should of a dog. The animal itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all
    picture-wolves&mdash;Red Riding Hood&rsquo;s quondam friend, whilst moving her confidence in masquerade.</p>

    <p>The whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The wicked wolf that for half a day had
    paralysed London and set all the children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of penitent
    mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most
    tender solicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble; didn&rsquo;t I say it all along? Here&rsquo;s his head
    all cut and full of broken glass. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s been a-gettin&rsquo; over some bloomin&rsquo; wall or other. It&rsquo;s a shyme that people are
    allowed to top their walls with broken bottles. This &rsquo;ere&rsquo;s what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker.&rdquo;</p>
