    <p>&ldquo;He has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna, whilst the ship that carried him rushed
    through enveloping fog up to Galatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from us. But his
    child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in God&rsquo;s Providence, the very thing that the evil-doer
    most reckoned on for his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. The hunter is taken in his own snare, as
    the great Psalmist says. For now that he think he is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us
    with so many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to sleep. He think, too, that as he cut
    himself off from knowing your mind, there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail! That terrible
    baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of
    freedom, when the sun rise and set. At such times you go by my volition and not by his; and this power to good of
    you and others, as you have won from your suffering at his hands. This is now
    all the more precious that he know it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our
    where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God is with us through all this blackness, and these many
    dark hours. We shall fellow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril ourselves that we become like him. Friend
    John, this has been a great hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. You must be scribe and write him
    all down, so that when the others return from their work you can give it to them; then they shall know as we
    do.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And so I have written it whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker has written with her typewriter all since
    she brought the MS. to us.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break"><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI<small>DR. SEWARD&rsquo;S DIARY</small></h2>
    <p><em>29 October.</em>&mdash;This is written in the train from Varna to Galatz. Last night we all assembled a little
    before the time of sunset. Each of us had done his work as well as he could; so far as thought, and endeavour, and
    opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and for our work when we get to Galatz. When the usual
    time came round Mrs. Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and more serious effort on
    the part of Van Helsing than has been usually necessary, she sank into the trance. Usually she speaks on a hint; but
    this time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty resolutely, before we could learn anything;
    at last her answer came:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only a steady swirl of water softly running
    against the hawser. I can hear men&rsquo;s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks. A
    gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away. There is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are
    dragged along. What is this? There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air blowing upon me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Here she stopped. She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay on the sofa, and raised both her hands,
    palms upwards, as if lifting a weight. Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding. Quincey raised his
    eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst Harker&rsquo;s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his Kukri.
    There was a long pause. We all knew that the time when she could speak was passing; but we felt that it was useless
    to say anything. Suddenly she sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Would none of you like a cup of tea? You must all be so tired!&rdquo; We could only make her happy, and so acquiesced.
    She bustled off to get tea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You see, my friends. <em>He</em> is close to land: he has left his earth-chest. But he has yet to get on shore. In
    the night he may lie hidden somewhere; but if he be not carried on shore, or if the ship do not touch it, he cannot
    achieve the land. In such case he can, if it be in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as he did at Whitby. But if the day come before he get on shore, then, unless he
    be carried he cannot escape. And if he be carried, then the customs men may discover what the box contain. Thus, in
    fine, if he escape not on shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him. We may then
    arrive in time; for if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for he
    dare not be his true self, awake and visible, lest he be discovered.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There was no more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn; at which time we might learn more from
    Mrs. Harker.</p>

    <p>Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her response in her trance. The hypnotic stage was
    even longer in coming than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was so short that we began
    to despair. Van Helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made
    reply:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;All is dark. I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as of wood on wood.&rdquo; She paused, and the red
    sun shot up. We must wait till to-night.</p>

    <p>And so it is that we are travelling towards Galatz in an agony of expectation. We are due to arrive between two
    and three in the morning; but already, at Bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot possibly get in till well
    after sun-up. Thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from Mrs. Harker; either or both may possibly throw more
    light on what is happening.</p>

    
    <p><em>Later.</em>&mdash;Sunset has come and gone. Fortunately it came at a time when there was no distraction; for
    had it occurred whilst we were at a station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation. Mrs. Harker
    yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning. I am in fear that her power of reading the
    Count&rsquo;s sensations may die away, just when we want it most. It seems to me that her imagination is beginning to
    work. Whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. If this goes on
    it may ultimately mislead us. If I thought that the Count&rsquo;s power over her would die away equally with her power of
    knowledge it would be a happy thought; but I am afraid that it may not be so. When she did speak, her words were
    enigmatical:&mdash;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Something is going out; I can feel it pass me like a cold wind. I can hear, far off, confused sounds&mdash;as of
    men talking in strange tongues, fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.&rdquo; She stopped and a shudder ran
    through her, increasing in intensity for a few seconds, till, at the end, she
    shook as though in a palsy. She said no more, even in answer to the Professor&rsquo;s imperative questioning. When she
    woke from the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was all alert. She could not remember
    anything, but asked what she had said; when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in
    silence.</p>
