    <p>"Yes, she did."</p>

    <p>"And what did she say?"</p>

    <p>"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had&mdash;not turned out well. At such a distance as
    <em>that</em>, you know, things are strangely misrepresented."</p>

    <p>"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:</p>

    <p>"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be
    doing there."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth. "It must be something particular, to
    take him there at this time of year."</p>

    <p>"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you
    had."</p>

    <p>"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."</p>

    <p>"And do you like her?"</p>

    <p>"Very much."</p>

    <p>"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not
    very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well."</p>

    <p>"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."</p>

    <p>"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"</p>

    <p>"I do not recollect that we did."</p>

    <p>"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful place!&mdash;Excellent
    Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect."</p>

    <p>"How should you have liked making sermons?"</p>

    <p>"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.
    One ought not to repine;&mdash;but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of
    such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
    circumstance, when you were in Kent?"</p>

    <p>"I have heard from authority, which I thought <em>as good</em>, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the
    will of the present patron."</p>

    <p>"You have. Yes, there was something in <em>that</em>; I told you so from the first, you may remember."</p>

    <p>"I <em>did</em> hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be
    at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been
    compromised accordingly."</p>

    <p>"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we
    talked of it."</p>

    <p>They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her
    sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:</p>

    <p>"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope
    we shall be always of one mind."</p>

    <p>She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they
    entered the house.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 53</h2>
    <p>Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked
    his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to
    keep him quiet.</p>

    <p>The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as
    her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a
    twelvemonth.</p>

    <p>"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps."</p>

    <p>"Write to me very often, my dear."</p>

    <p>"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for writing. My sisters may write to
    <em>me</em>. They will have nothing else to do."</p>

    <p>Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many
    pretty things.</p>

    <p>"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw. He simpers, and
    smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a
    more valuable son-in-law."</p>

    <p>The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.</p>

    <p>"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn
    without them."</p>

    <p>"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth. "It must make you better
    satisfied that your other four are single."</p>

    <p>"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband's regiment
    happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."</p>

    <p>But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to
    the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield
    had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there
    for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by
    turns.</p>

    <p>"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). "Well,
    so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure <em>I</em> never
    want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what
    <em>may</em> happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.
    And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"</p>

    <p>"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by,
    and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He comes down on
    Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order
    in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."</p>

    <p>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had
    mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:</p>

    <p>"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared
    distressed. But don't imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I
    <em>should</em> be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad
    of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of <em>myself</em>, but
    I dread other people's remarks."</p>
