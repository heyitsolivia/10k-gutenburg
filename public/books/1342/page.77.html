    <p>Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her
    presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort
    to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the
    design of cheering and heartening them up&mdash;though, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of
    Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
    them.</p>

    <p>All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.
    He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of
    seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family. Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man
    in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.
    Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
    her sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more
    especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely
    despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.</p>

    <p>Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his
    arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet
    had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was
    now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have
    gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not
    expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He
    added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon.
    There was also a postscript to this effect:</p>

    <p>"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates
    in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town
    he has now concealed himself. If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue
    as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare
    say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us
    what relations he has now living, better than any other person."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in
    her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never heard of his
    having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,
    however, that some of his companions in the &mdash;&mdash;shire might be able to give more information; and though
    she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.</p>

    <p>Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was
    expected. The arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters, whatever of
    good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of
    importance.</p>

    <p>But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from
    Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly
    read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It
    was as follows:</p>

    "MY DEAR SIR,
    <p>"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous
    affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be
    assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in
    your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can
    remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune&mdash;or that may comfort
    you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your
    daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is
    reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
    proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs.
    Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an
    enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only
    joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They
    agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the
    others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family? And
    this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November;
    for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear
    sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and
    leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.</p>

    <p>"I am, dear sir, etc., etc."</p>

    <p>Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of
    a pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any
    connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since
    he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. There
    was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his
    own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's
    relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.
    Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He
    owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to
    conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. "A gamester!" she cried. "This is
    wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it."</p>
