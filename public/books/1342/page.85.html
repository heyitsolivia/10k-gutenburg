    <p>"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I
    believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon
    <em>her</em>, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have
    given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been
    so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in
    <em>this</em>; though I doubt whether <em>his</em> reserve, or <em>anybody's</em> reserve, can be answerable for the
    event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
    never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for <em>another interest</em> in the affair.</p>

    <p>"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was
    agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive
    the last finish.</p>

    <p>"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I
    hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the
    house. <em>He</em> was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little
    I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday,
    that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no
    fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what
    she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am
    sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for
    their sakes had patience with her.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next
    day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take
    this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us
    has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me;
    he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and <em>that</em>, if he marry <em>prudently</em>, his wife may teach
    him. I thought him very sly;&mdash;he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.</p>

    <p>"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I
    shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies,
    would be the very thing.</p>

    <p>"But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour.</p>

    <p>"Yours, very sincerely,</p>

    "M. GARDINER."
    <p>The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine
    whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced
    of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage as an
    exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation,
    were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself
    all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman
    whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and
    finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to
    pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he
    had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her
    vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her&mdash;for a woman who had already refused
    him&mdash;as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law
    of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to
    think how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It
    was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and
    though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining
    partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It
    was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
    return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over
    every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For
    herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able
    to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough;
    but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly
    both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and
    herself.</p>

    <p>She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into
    another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.</p>

    <p>"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her.</p>

    <p>"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be
    unwelcome."</p>

    <p>"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and now we are better."</p>

    <p>"True. Are the others coming out?"</p>

    <p>"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from
    our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley."</p>

    <p>She replied in the affirmative.</p>

    <p>"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way
    to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of
    course she did not mention my name to you."</p>
