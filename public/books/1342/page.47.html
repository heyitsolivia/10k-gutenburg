    <p>As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be
    thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:</p>

    <p>"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative,
    and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant,
    distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case <em>here</em>. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but
    not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys&mdash;and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself
    <em>near</em> her family under less than <em>half</em> the present distance."</p>

    <p>Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "<em>You</em> cannot have a right to such very strong
    local attachment. <em>You</em> cannot have been always at Longbourn."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a
    newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:</p>

    <p>"Are you pleased with Kent?"</p>

    <p>A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise&mdash;and soon put an end
    to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised them. Mr.
    Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer
    without saying much to anybody, went away.</p>

    <p>"What can be the meaning of this?" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone. "My dear, Eliza, he must be in love
    with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way."</p>

    <p>But when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case;
    and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding
    anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there
    was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of
    the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a
    temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning,
    sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that
    Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him
    still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident
    admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less
    captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.</p>

    <p>But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for
    society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed
    the effect of necessity rather than of choice&mdash;a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom
    appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at
    his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and
    as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza,
    she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he
    came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of
    that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much
    admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.</p>

    <p>She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always
    laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising
    expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her
    friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.</p>

    <p>In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond
    comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to
    counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none
    at all.</p>

    <p>More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the
    perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever
    happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second
    time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary
    penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he
    actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself
    the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was
    asking some odd unconnected questions&mdash;about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and
    her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding
    the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying <em>there</em> too. His
    words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he
    must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to
    find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.</p>

    <p>She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved
    that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up
    that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:</p>

    <p>"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."</p>

    <p>"I have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with
    a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?"</p>
