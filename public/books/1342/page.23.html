    <p>"It is difficult indeed&mdash;it is distressing. One does not know what to think."</p>

    <p>"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think."</p>

    <p>But Jane could think with certainty on only one point&mdash;that Mr. Bingley, if he <em>had</em> been imposed on,
    would have much to suffer when the affair became public.</p>

    <p>The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very
    persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the
    long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see
    their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with
    herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much
    as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from
    their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs.
    Bennet's civilities.</p>

    <p>The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to
    consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the
    invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
    society of her two friends, and the attentions of her brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a
    great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look and behaviour. The
    happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though
    they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who
    could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no
    disinclination for it.</p>

    <p>"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough&mdash;I think it is no sacrifice to join
    occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider
    intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr.
    Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did,
    whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he
    entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or
    Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.</p>

    <p>"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of
    character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that
    I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this
    opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my
    cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very
    dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for it,
    however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal
    accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it
    suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that <em>she</em> was selected from among her sisters as worthy
    of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of
    more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward
    herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
    gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the
    probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to <em>her</em>. Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the
    hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the
    offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.</p>

    <p>If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in
    a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a
    succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought
    after&mdash;the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her
    patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less
    than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and
    Lydia.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 18</h2>
    <p>Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of
    red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had
    not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with
    more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his
    heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the
    dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the
    officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend
    Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the
    day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, "I do not imagine his business would have
    called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here."</p>

    <p>This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that
    Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of
    displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with
    tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance, forbearance,
    patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned
    away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind
    partiality provoked her.</p>
