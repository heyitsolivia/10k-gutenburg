    <p>Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three.
    Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said:</p>

    <p>"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue."</p>

    <p>But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered:</p>

    <p>"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would
    be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye."</p>

    <p>She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane
    was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 11</h2>
    <p>When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold,
    attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and
    Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
    Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an
    anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.</p>

    <p>But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned
    toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss
    Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but
    diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was
    spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the
    other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely
    to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.</p>

    <p>When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table&mdash;but in vain. She had obtained
    private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition
    rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to
    justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.
    Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets
    and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.</p>

    <p>Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through <em>his</em> book, as
    in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win
    him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the
    attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave
    a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
    enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall
    be miserable if I have not an excellent library."</p>

    <p>No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for
    some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and
    said:</p>

    <p>"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you
    determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to
    whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."</p>

    <p>"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins&mdash;but as for the
    ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my
    cards."</p>

    <p>"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there
    is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if
    conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day."</p>

    <p>"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."</p>

    <p>Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant,
    and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her
    feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:</p>

    <p>"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is
    very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her
    civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself
    could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it,
    observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with
    either of which motives his joining them would interfere. "What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be
    his meaning?"&mdash;and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?</p>

    <p>"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of
    disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it."</p>

    <p>Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in
    requiring an explanation of his two motives.</p>

    <p>"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. "You either
    choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret affairs to
    discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I
    would be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire."</p>

    <p>"Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. "I never heard anything so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a
    speech?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth. "We can all plague and punish one another.
    Tease him&mdash;laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."</p>
