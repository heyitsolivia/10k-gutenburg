    <p>"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies
    to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and
    that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by
    what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."</p>

    <p>"Upon my word, sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure
    you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their
    happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make
    <em>me</em> happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your
    friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
    situation."</p>

    <p>"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins very gravely&mdash;"but I cannot imagine
    that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again,
    I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification."</p>

    <p>"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay
    me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in
    my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
    feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any
    self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus spoke, she
    would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her:</p>

    <p>"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable
    answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be
    the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as
    much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character."</p>

    <p>"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said
    can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince
    you of its being one."</p>

    <p>"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of
    course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your
    acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my
    connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour;
    and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means
    certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all
    likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are
    not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense,
    according to the usual practice of elegant females."</p>

    <p>"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting
    a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for
    the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every
    respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as
    a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart."</p>

    <p>"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when
    sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being
    acceptable."</p>

    <p>To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence
    withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to
    her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
    not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.</p>

    <p>Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled
    about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick
    step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
    warm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations
    with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he
    trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would
    naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.</p>

    <p>This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her
    daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not
    help saying so.</p>

    <p>"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about
    it directly. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will <em>make</em> her
    know it."</p>

    <p>"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know
    not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for
    happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not
    to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my
    felicity."</p>

    <p>"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. "Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.
    In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very
    soon settle it with her, I am sure."</p>
