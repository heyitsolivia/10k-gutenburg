    <p>"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party."</p>

    <p>"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My
    fingers wait your orders."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to
    recommend myself to strangers."</p>

    <p>"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. "Shall we
    ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to
    strangers?"</p>

    <p>"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to him. It is because he will not give himself
    the trouble."</p>

    <p>"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have
    never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see
    done."</p>

    <p>"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many
    women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always
    supposed it to be my own fault&mdash;because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not
    believe <em>my</em> fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."</p>

    <p>Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the
    privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers."</p>

    <p>Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth
    immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to
    Darcy:</p>

    <p>"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master.
    She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have been a delightful
    performer, had her health allowed her to learn."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor
    at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she
    derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry <em>her</em>, had she been his
    relation.</p>

    <p>Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution
    and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen,
    remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on
    business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had
    heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away
    her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very
    great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.</p>

    <p>He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had
    understood all the ladies were to be within.</p>

    <p>They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total
    silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting
    <em>when</em> she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of
    their hasty departure, she observed:</p>

    <p>"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable
    surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He
    and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?"</p>

    <p>"Perfectly so, I thank you."</p>

    <p>She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause added:</p>

    <p>"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"</p>

    <p>"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future.
    He has many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing."</p>

    <p>"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the
    place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the
    house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it
    on the same principle."</p>

    <p>"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was
    now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.</p>

    <p>He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a
    great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford."</p>

    <p>"I believe she did&mdash;and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife."</p>

    <p>"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would
    have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding&mdash;though I am
    not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy,
    however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her."</p>

    <p>"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends."</p>

    <p>"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."</p>

    <p>"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey. Yes, I call it a <em>very</em> easy
    distance."</p>

    <p>"I should never have considered the distance as one of the <em>advantages</em> of the match," cried Elizabeth. "I
    should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled <em>near</em> her family."</p>

    <p>"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I
    suppose, would appear far."</p>
