    <p>"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of
    reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But
    with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been
    a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was
    not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
    Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves
    (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish
    and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish
    at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty;
    and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a
    lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt
    of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being
    pleased."</p>

    <p>"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"</p>

    <p>"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."</p>

    <p>"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my
    spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after <em>that</em> evening?"</p>

    <p>"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."</p>

    <p>"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?"</p>

    <p>"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."</p>

    <p>"Your surprise could not be greater than <em>mine</em> in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I
    deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive <em>more</em> than my due."</p>

    <p>"My object then," replied Darcy, "was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to
    resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your
    reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in
    about half an hour after I had seen you."</p>

    <p>He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden
    interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
    following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity
    and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.</p>

    <p>She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.</p>

    <p>After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on
    examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.</p>

    <p>"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy
    was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.</p>

    <p>"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.</p>

    <p>"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."</p>

    <p>"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much." And though he exclaimed at the term, she
    found that it had been pretty much the case.</p>

    <p>"On the evening before my going to London," said he, "I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have
    made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and
    impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed
    myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive
    that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.</p>

    <p>"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from
    my information last spring?"</p>

    <p>"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was
    convinced of her affection."</p>

    <p>"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him."</p>

    <p>"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in
    so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a
    time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three
    months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am
    persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
    now."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth
    was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather
    too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
    continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.</p>

    <p>"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as
    she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in reply, that they
    had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
    else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.</p>

    <p>The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the
    unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth,
    agitated and confused, rather <em>knew</em> that she was happy than <em>felt</em> herself to be so; for, besides the
    immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when
    her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it
    was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.</p>
