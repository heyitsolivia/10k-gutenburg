    <p>"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in
    adhering to it?"</p>

    <p>"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself."</p>

    <p>"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.
    Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the
    friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it
    without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."</p>

    <p>"To yield readily&mdash;easily&mdash;to the <em>persuasion</em> of a friend is no merit with you."</p>

    <p>"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either."</p>

    <p>"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the
    requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am
    not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till
    the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary
    cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great
    moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into
    it?"</p>

    <p>"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of
    importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the
    parties?"</p>

    <p>"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and
    size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if
    Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I
    declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own
    house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do."</p>

    <p>Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her
    laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking
    such nonsense.</p>

    <p>"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend. "You dislike an argument, and want to silence this."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the
    room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."</p>

    <p>"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his
    letter."</p>

    <p>Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.</p>

    <p>When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss
    Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way
    which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she
    turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her. She
    hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look
    at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his
    notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other
    person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.</p>

    <p>After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr.
    Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her:</p>

    <p>"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"</p>

    <p>She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.</p>

    <p>"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I
    know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing
    those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to
    tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all&mdash;and now despise me if you dare."</p>

    <p>"Indeed I do not dare."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of
    sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so
    bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her
    connections, he should be in some danger.</p>

    <p>Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend
    Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.</p>

    <p>She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning
    his happiness in such an alliance.</p>

    <p>"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your
    mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if
    you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a
    subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady
    possesses."</p>

    <p>"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?"</p>

    <p>"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them
    next to your great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for your
    Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"</p>

    <p>"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so
    remarkably fine, might be copied."</p>

    <p>At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.</p>

    <p>"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been
    overheard.</p>

    <p>"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "running away without telling us that you were coming
    out."</p>
