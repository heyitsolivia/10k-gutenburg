    <p>"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable
    man, that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her
    for half-an-hour without once opening his lips."</p>

    <p>"Are you quite sure, ma'am?&mdash;is not there a little mistake?" said Jane. "I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking
    to her."</p>

    <p>"Aye&mdash;because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she
    said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to."</p>

    <p>"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With
    <em>them</em> he is remarkably agreeable."</p>

    <p>"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But
    I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs.
    Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."</p>

    <p>"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza."</p>

    <p>"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with <em>him</em>, if I were you."</p>

    <p>"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you <em>never</em> to dance with him."</p>

    <p>"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend <em>me</em> so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse
    for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should
    think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a <em>right</em> to be proud."</p>

    <p>"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive <em>his</em> pride, if he had not mortified
    <em>mine</em>."</p>

    <p>"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing, I
    believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is
    particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the
    score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often
    used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity
    to what we would have others think of us."</p>

    <p>"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas, who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I
    was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day."</p>

    <p>"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs. Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I
    should take away your bottle directly."</p>

    <p>The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with
    the visit.</p>

    <p>The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was soon returned in due form. Miss
    Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be
    intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with <em>them</em> was
    expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth
    still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like
    them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of
    their brother's admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he <em>did</em> admire her and to
    <em>her</em> it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him
    from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to
    be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and
    a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to
    her friend Miss Lucas.</p>

    <p>"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is
    sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the
    object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the
    world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe
    to leave any to itself. We can all <em>begin</em> freely&mdash;a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
    very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women
    had better show <em>more</em> affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do
    more than like her, if she does not help him on."</p>

    <p>"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a
    simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too."</p>

    <p>"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."</p>

    <p>"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for
    many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment
    should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can
    command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she
    chooses."</p>

    <p>"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married,
    and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not
    Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor
    of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him
    one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make
    her understand his character."</p>

    <p>"Not as you represent it. Had she merely <em>dined</em> with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a
    good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together&mdash;and four evenings may do
    a great deal."</p>
