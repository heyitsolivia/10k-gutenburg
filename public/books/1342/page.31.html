    <p>The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the
    uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother. As for
    the gentleman himself, <em>his</em> feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying
    to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous
    attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
    civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.</p>

    <p>The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same
    state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear
    in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.</p>

    <p>After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his
    absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt's
    where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he
    voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence <em>had</em> been self-imposed.</p>

    <p>"I found," said he, "as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the
    same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise
    unpleasant to more than myself."</p>

    <p>She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the
    commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to
    Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she
    felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her
    father and mother.</p>

    <p>Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained
    a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her
    sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane
    recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general
    conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no
    sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they
    had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:</p>

    <p>"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left
    Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town&mdash;and without any intention of coming back again. You
    shall hear what she says."</p>

    <p>She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow
    their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The
    next was in these words: "I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society,
    my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we
    have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved
    correspondence. I depend on you for that." To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the
    insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to
    lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and
    as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.</p>

    <p>"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they
    leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may
    arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with
    yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them."</p>

    <p>"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to
    you:"</p>

    <p>"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in
    three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to
    town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be
    obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter;
    I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd&mdash;but of that
    I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally
    brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall
    deprive you."</p>

    <p>"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter."</p>

    <p>"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he <em>should</em>."</p>

    <p>"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master. But you do not know <em>all</em>. I
    <em>will</em> read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from <em>you</em>."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, <em>we</em> are scarcely less eager to meet
    her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the
    affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we
    dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings
    on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
    unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the
    most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is not
    misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances
    to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event
    which will secure the happiness of so many?"</p>
