    <p>Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite
    with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a
    sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own
    easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on
    the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing
    in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:</p>

    <p>"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you
    please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill."</p>

    <p>Lydia declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yes&mdash;it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that
    time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given <em>your</em> ball," she added, "I
    shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her
    relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be
    prevailed on to join in their censure of <em>her</em>, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on <em>fine
    eyes</em>.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
    <p>The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning
    with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the
    drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was
    watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst
    and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his
    companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or
    on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious
    dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each.</p>

    <p>"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"</p>

    <p>He made no answer.</p>

    <p>"You write uncommonly fast."</p>

    <p>"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."</p>

    <p>"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I
    should think them!"</p>

    <p>"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours."</p>

    <p>"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."</p>

    <p>"I have already told her so once, by your desire."</p>

    <p>"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well."</p>

    <p>"Thank you&mdash;but I always mend my own."</p>

    <p>"How can you contrive to write so even?"</p>

    <p>He was silent.</p>

    <p>"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in
    raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's."</p>

    <p>"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present I have not room to do them
    justice."</p>

    <p>"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to
    her, Mr. Darcy?"</p>

    <p>"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine."</p>

    <p>"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill."</p>

    <p>"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother, "because he does <em>not</em> write with
    ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?"</p>

    <p>"My style of writing is very different from yours."</p>

    <p>"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and
    blots the rest."</p>

    <p>"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them&mdash;by which means my letters sometimes convey
    no ideas at all to my correspondents."</p>

    <p>"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."</p>

    <p>"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of
    opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."</p>

    <p>"And which of the two do you call <em>my</em> little recent piece of modesty?"</p>

    <p>"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding
    from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly
    interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without
    any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever
    resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of
    compliment to yourself&mdash;and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very
    necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?"</p>

    <p>"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the
    morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At
    least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the
    ladies."</p>

    <p>"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your
    conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a
    friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
    go&mdash;and at another word, might stay a month."</p>

    <p>"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You
    have shown him off now much more than he did himself."</p>

    <p>"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the
    sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he
    would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast
    as I could."</p>
