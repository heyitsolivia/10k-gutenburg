    <p>"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.</p>

    "MY DEAR NIECE,
    <p>"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a
    <em>little</em> writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your
    application; I did not expect it from <em>you</em>. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know
    that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on <em>your</em> side. If you do not choose to understand me,
    forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am&mdash;and nothing but the belief of your being a
    party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be
    more explicit.</p>

    <p>"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called,
    and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully
    racked as <em>yours</em> seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and
    Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can
    collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them.
    The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so
    well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He generously
    imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private
    actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward,
    and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he <em>had another</em> motive, I am sure it
    would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something
    to direct his search, which was more than <em>we</em> had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his
    resolving to follow us.</p>

    <p>"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from
    her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in
    Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately
    acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or
    three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery
    and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their
    first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode
    with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in &mdash;&mdash; street.
    He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to
    persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed
    on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on
    remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving
    Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were
    her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation
    with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been <em>his</em> design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,
    on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of
    Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future
    situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he
    should have nothing to live on.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very
    rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But
    he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by
    marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the
    temptation of immediate relief.</p>

    <p>"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but
    at length was reduced to be reasonable.</p>

    <p>"Every thing being settled between <em>them</em>, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it,
    and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and
    Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He
    did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily
    postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was
    only known that a gentleman had called on business.</p>

    <p>"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great
    deal of talk together.</p>

    <p>"They met again on Sunday, and then <em>I</em> saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it
    was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is
    the real defect of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but <em>this</em>
    is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be
    thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.</p>

    <p>"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it
    deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was
    forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really
    believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of
    his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or
    Jane at most.</p>
