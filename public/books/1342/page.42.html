    <p>Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room,
    which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden
    gate.</p>

    <p>"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is
    nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter."</p>

    <p>"La! my dear," said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs.
    Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who
    would have thought that she could be so thin and small?"</p>

    <p>"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in."</p>

    <p>"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. "She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do
    for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife."</p>

    <p>Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to
    Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and
    constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.</p>

    <p>At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr.
    Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte
    explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.</p>

    <p>Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of
    his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was
    exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of
    Lady Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.</p>

    <p>"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to
    drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would
    happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an
    invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your
    arrival!"</p>

    <p>"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of
    the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of
    elegant breeding are not uncommon."</p>

    <p>Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was
    carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so
    splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.</p>

    <p>When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that
    elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your
    clothes is superior to the rest&mdash;there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the
    worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."</p>

    <p>While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as
    Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and
    her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to
    her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St.
    James's.</p>

    <p>As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty
    and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr.
    Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of
    the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.</p>

    <p>When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not
    look perfectly calm. Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her
    awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she
    could witness without trepidation.</p>

    <p>From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the
    finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her
    daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as
    Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a
    proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.</p>

    <p>In spite of having been at St. James's Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that
    he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter,
    frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found
    herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was a
    tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating,
    nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered
    formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance,
    and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she
    believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.</p>

    <p>When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr.
    Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so
    thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and
    sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to
    Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what
    she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.</p>
