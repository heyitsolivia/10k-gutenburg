    <p>"Then it is as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"</p>

    <p>Elizabeth read on:</p>

    <p>"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
    willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before
    they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five
    thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter
    into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which,
    considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I
    shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from
    these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The
    world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even when all his
    debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you
    send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to
    Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again;
    therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can,
    and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which
    I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on.
    Yours, etc.,</p>

    "EDW. GARDINER."
    <p>"Is it possible?" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. "Can it be possible that he will marry her?"</p>

    <p>"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him," said her sister. "My dear father, I congratulate
    you."</p>

    <p>"And have you answered the letter?" cried Elizabeth.</p>

    <p>"No; but it must be done soon."</p>

    <p>Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he wrote.</p>

    <p>"Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such
    a case."</p>

    <p>"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself."</p>

    <p>"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."</p>

    <p>And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.</p>

    <p>"And may I ask&mdash;" said Elizabeth; "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."</p>

    <p>"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."</p>

    <p>"And they <em>must</em> marry! Yet he is <em>such</em> a man!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to
    know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay
    him."</p>

    <p>"Money! My uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, sir?"</p>

    <p>"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my
    life, and fifty after I am gone."</p>

    <p>"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and
    something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed
    himself. A small sum could not do all this."</p>

    <p>"No," said her father; "Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should
    be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."</p>

    <p>"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their
    father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.</p>

    <p>"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. "How strange this is!
    And for <em>this</em> we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and
    wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!"</p>

    <p>"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real
    regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand
    pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare
    half ten thousand pounds?"</p>

    <p>"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his
    side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of
    his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their
    personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough
    acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will
    never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!"</p>

    <p>"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be
    happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their
    mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a
    manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten."</p>

    <p>"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is
    useless to talk of it."</p>

    <p>It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.
    They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.
    He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied:</p>

    <p>"Just as you please."</p>

    <p>"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"</p>

    <p>"Take whatever you like, and get away."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with
    Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, the letter
    was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's
    being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was now in an
    irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter
    would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her
    misconduct.</p>
