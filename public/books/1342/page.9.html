    <p>When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered
    her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting
    with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield
    for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the
    family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
    <p>At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the
    civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior
    solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters,
    on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold,
    and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
    indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former
    dislike.</p>

    <p>Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for
    Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an
    intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley
    was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an
    indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a
    ragout, had nothing to say to her.</p>

    <p>When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of
    the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no
    conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:</p>

    <p>"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance
    this morning. She really looked almost wild."</p>

    <p>"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must
    <em>she</em> be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the
    gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office."</p>

    <p>"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth
    Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my
    notice."</p>

    <p>"<em>You</em> observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not
    wish to see <em>your</em> sister make such an exhibition."</p>

    <p>"Certainly not."</p>

    <p>"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite
    alone! What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most
    country-town indifference to decorum."</p>

    <p>"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley.</p>

    <p>"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your
    admiration of her fine eyes."</p>

    <p>"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise." A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs.
    Hurst began again:</p>

    <p>"I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart
    she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance
    of it."</p>

    <p>"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton."</p>

    <p>"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."</p>

    <p>"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.</p>

    <p>"If they had uncles enough to fill <em>all</em> Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less
    agreeable."</p>

    <p>"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied
    Darcy.</p>

    <p>To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for
    some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.</p>

    <p>With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her
    till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the
    evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she
    should go downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately
    invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said
    she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with
    astonishment.</p>

    <p>"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular."</p>

    <p>"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything
    else."</p>

    <p>"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am <em>not</em> a great reader, and I have
    pleasure in many things."</p>

    <p>"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and I hope it will be soon increased by
    seeing her quite well."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying. He
    immediately offered to fetch her others&mdash;all that his library afforded.</p>

    <p>"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I
    have not many, I have more than I ever looked into."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.</p>

    <p>"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books. What a
    delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"</p>

    <p>"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations."</p>

    <p>"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books."</p>

    <p>"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these."</p>
