    <p>The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked
    her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into
    the &mdash;&mdash;shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him
    accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in
    Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never
    felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every
    virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that
    might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual
    errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years'
    continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air
    and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
    the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she
    once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some
    confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she
    was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself&mdash;from whom she had previously
    received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to
    question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the
    application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a
    proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.</p>

    <p>She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first
    evening at Mr. Phillips's. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was <em>now</em> struck with
    the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy
    of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered
    that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy&mdash;that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
    <em>he</em> should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also
    that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that
    after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr.
    Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the
    son.</p>

    <p>How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the
    consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the
    moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had no
    tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by
    encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his
    favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr.
    Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
    were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance&mdash;an acquaintance which had latterly
    brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways&mdash;seen anything that betrayed him to
    be unprincipled or unjust&mdash;anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own
    connections he was esteemed and valued&mdash;that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had
    often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of <em>some</em> amiable feeling; that
    had his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have
    been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr.
    Bingley, was incomprehensible.</p>

    <p>She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been
    blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.</p>

    <p>"How despicably I have acted!" she cried; "I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself
    on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or
    blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not
    have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and
    offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and
    ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."</p>

    <p>From herself to Jane&mdash;from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her
    recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation <em>there</em> had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely
    different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,
    which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister's
    attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the
    justice of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that
    there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.</p>

    <p>When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet
    merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and
    the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all
    his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.</p>
