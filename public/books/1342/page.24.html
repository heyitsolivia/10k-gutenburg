    <p>But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening,
    it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for
    a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her
    particular notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.
    Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it,
    gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her
    release from him was ecstasy.</p>

    <p>She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was
    universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her,
    when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her
    hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to
    fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her:</p>

    <p>"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."</p>

    <p>"Heaven forbid! <em>That</em> would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is
    determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil."</p>

    <p>When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help
    cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in
    the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the
    dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours'
    looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
    imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till
    suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight
    observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a
    second time with:&mdash;"It is <em>your</em> turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and
    <em>you</em> ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."</p>

    <p>He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.</p>

    <p>"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much
    pleasanter than public ones. But <em>now</em> we may be silent."</p>

    <p>"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?"</p>

    <p>"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together;
    and yet for the advantage of <em>some</em>, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of
    saying as little as possible."</p>

    <p>"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"</p>

    <p>"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. We are
    each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the
    whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."</p>

    <p>"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said he. "How near it may be to
    <em>mine</em>, I cannot pretend to say. <em>You</em> think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."</p>

    <p>"I must not decide on my own performance."</p>

    <p>He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her
    sisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation,
    added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."</p>

    <p>The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of <em>hauteur</em> overspread his features, but he said not a word, and
    Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained
    manner said, "Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his <em>making</em> friends&mdash;whether
    he may be equally capable of <em>retaining</em> them, is less certain."</p>

    <p>"He has been so unlucky as to lose <em>your</em> friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner
    which he is likely to suffer from all his life."</p>

    <p>Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared
    close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he
    stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.</p>

    <p>"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is
    evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace
    you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear
    Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr.
    Darcy:&mdash;but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse
    of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."</p>

    <p>The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to
    strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were
    dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "Sir William's
    interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."</p>

    <p>"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had
    less to say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of
    next I cannot imagine."</p>

    <p>"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.</p>

    <p>"Books&mdash;oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."</p>

    <p>"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. We may compare our
    different opinions."</p>

    <p>"No&mdash;I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else."</p>

    <p>"The <em>present</em> always occupies you in such scenes&mdash;does it?" said he, with a look of doubt.</p>
