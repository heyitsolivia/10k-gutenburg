    <p>It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the
    head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage
    of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
    accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new
    carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter,
    and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
    importance.</p>

    <p>"Haye Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings could quit it&mdash;or the great house at Stoke, if the
    drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
    Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."</p>

    <p>Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn,
    he said to her: "Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a
    right understanding. Into <em>one</em> house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not
    encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."</p>

    <p>A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found,
    with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested
    that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
    it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a
    privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible. She was
    more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense
    of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy
    acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to
    the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
    spot.</p>

    <p>She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have
    more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have
    mortified her so much&mdash;not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any
    rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms,
    it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection, would
    now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.</p>

    <p>From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she had
    assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was
    humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she
    could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining
    intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should
    meet.</p>

    <p>What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only
    four months ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as
    the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.</p>

    <p>She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His
    understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have
    been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
    and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater
    importance.</p>

    <p>But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of
    a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.</p>

    <p>How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine. But how little of
    permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger
    than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance
    of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might
    never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had
    resolved on quitting the militia.</p>

    <p>"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you
    will agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my
    niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some
    who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General &mdash;&mdash;'s
    regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He
    promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both
    be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that
    he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for
    which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors
    in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at
    least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then
    join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is
    very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you
    and your mother.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>
