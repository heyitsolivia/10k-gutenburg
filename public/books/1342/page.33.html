    <p>Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful
    alacrity. Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could
    give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to
    calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely
    to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
    Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.
    James's. The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of
    <em>coming out</em> a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their
    apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point,
    and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither
    sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be
    her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the
    only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be
    their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven,
    without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the
    business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other
    person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her
    feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore
    charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the
    family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for
    the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some
    ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his
    prosperous love.</p>

    <p>As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was
    performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy
    they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them.</p>

    <p>"My dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping
    to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."</p>

    <p>They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately
    said:</p>

    <p>"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir? You had better neglect your
    relations than run the risk of offending your patroness."</p>

    <p>"My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may
    depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."</p>

    <p>"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to
    be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be
    satisfied that <em>we</em> shall take no offence."</p>

    <p>"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you
    will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in
    Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now
    take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."</p>

    <p>With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return.
    Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary
    might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a
    solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if
    encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. But
    on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
    private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.</p>

    <p>The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within
    the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could
    encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum,
    and she could not help crying out:</p>

    <p>"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte&mdash;impossible!"</p>

    <p>The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion
    here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her
    composure, and calmly replied:</p>

    <p>"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to
    procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"</p>

    <p>But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable
    firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable
    happiness.</p>

    <p>"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte. "You must be surprised, very much surprised&mdash;so lately as
    Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with
    what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr.
    Collins's character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as
    fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.
    Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time
    before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making
    two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt
    that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that,
    when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of
    Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem,
    was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had
    chosen.</p>
