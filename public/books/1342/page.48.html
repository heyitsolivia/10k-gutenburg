    <p>"No, I should have turned in a moment."</p>

    <p>And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.</p>

    <p>"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.</p>

    <p>"Yes&mdash;if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he
    pleases."</p>

    <p>"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I
    do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy."</p>

    <p>"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. "But so we all do. It is only that he has
    better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A
    younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."</p>

    <p>"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now seriously, what have you ever
    known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or
    procuring anything you had a fancy for?"</p>

    <p>"These are home questions&mdash;and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature.
    But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like."</p>

    <p>"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do."</p>

    <p>"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry
    without some attention to money."</p>

    <p>"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a
    lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I
    suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."</p>

    <p>He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her
    affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said:</p>

    <p>"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder
    he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the
    present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."</p>

    <p>"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the
    guardianship of Miss Darcy."</p>

    <p>"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young
    ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to
    have her own way."</p>

    <p>As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she
    supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near
    the truth. She directly replied:</p>

    <p>"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable
    creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss
    Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them."</p>

    <p>"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man&mdash;he is a great friend of Darcy's."</p>

    <p>"Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily; "Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of
    care of him."</p>

    <p>"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy <em>does</em> take care of him in those points where he most wants care.
    From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But
    I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all
    conjecture."</p>

    <p>"What is it you mean?"</p>

    <p>"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the
    lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."</p>

    <p>"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."</p>

    <p>"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that
    he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but
    without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind
    of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last
    summer."</p>

    <p>"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?"</p>

    <p>"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady."</p>

    <p>"And what arts did he use to separate them?"</p>

    <p>"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam, smiling. "He only told me what I have now told
    you."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After watching her a little,
    Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.</p>

    <p>"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. "Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why
    was he to be the judge?"</p>

    <p>"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"</p>

    <p>"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his
    own judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. But," she continued,
    recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed
    that there was much affection in the case."</p>

    <p>"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph
    very sadly."</p>

    <p>This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust
    herself with an answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they
    reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without
    interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those
    with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world <em>two</em> men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such
    boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never
    doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own
    vanity, however, did not mislead him, <em>he</em> was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that
    Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most
    affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.</p>
