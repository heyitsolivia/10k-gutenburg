    <p>"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the
    present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My
    sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel
    Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London;
    and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham,
    undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose
    character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to
    Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was
    persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her
    excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined
    them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of
    grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may
    imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I
    wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.
    Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help
    supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete
    indeed.</p>

    <p>"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not
    absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in
    what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at.
    Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion
    certainly not in your inclination.</p>

    <p>"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to
    know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to
    the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one
    of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions.
    If your abhorrence of <em>me</em> should make <em>my</em> assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same
    cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to
    find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add, God bless
    you.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 36</h2>
    <p>If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had
    formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly she went
    through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.
    With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she
    persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
    prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with
    an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence
    might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's
    insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match,
    made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which
    satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.</p>

    <p>But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham&mdash;when she read with somewhat clearer
    attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore
    so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself&mdash;her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more
    difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it
    entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest
    falsehood!"&mdash;and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page
    or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.</p>

    <p>In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in
    half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the
    mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every
    sentence. The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the
    kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.
    So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had
    said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that
    there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes
    did not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of
    Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand
    pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to
    be impartiality&mdash;deliberated on the probability of each statement&mdash;but with little success. On both sides
    it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed
    it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was
    capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.</p>
