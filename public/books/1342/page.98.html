    <p>At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was
    absolutely incredulous here.</p>

    <p>"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!&mdash;engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it
    to be impossible."</p>

    <p>"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me,
    if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are
    engaged."</p>

    <p>Jane looked at her doubtingly. "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him."</p>

    <p>"You know nothing of the matter. <em>That</em> is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I
    do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it
    myself."</p>

    <p>Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.</p>

    <p>"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried Jane. "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would&mdash;I
    do congratulate you&mdash;but are you certain? forgive the question&mdash;are you quite certain that you can be
    happy with him?"</p>

    <p>"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the
    world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"</p>

    <p>"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it
    as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without
    affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel <em>more</em> than I ought to do, when I tell you all."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry."</p>

    <p>"My dearest sister, now <em>be</em> serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to
    know, without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"</p>

    <p>"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first
    seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."</p>

    <p>Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by
    her solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.</p>

    <p>"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for
    nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there
    can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How
    little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to
    you."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state
    of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her
    his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is
    not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I
    had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we
    do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be
    always giving him such an epithet.</p>

    <p>As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no
    doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in
    which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"</p>

    <p>"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice
    long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view."</p>

    <p>"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't
    it, Kitty?" Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the
    Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:</p>

    <p>"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you
    will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now
    and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."</p>

    <p>During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.
    Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother would take
    it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.
    But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner
    would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the
    first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and
    her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made
    unhappy; and that it should be through her means&mdash;that <em>she</em>, his favourite child, should be distressing
    him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her&mdash;was a wretched reflection,
    and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.
    In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work
    said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly.</p>

    <p>Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. "Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? Are you
    out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"</p>

    <p>How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!
    It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were
    now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.</p>
