    <p>"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off.
    Must it be so?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, lord! yes;&mdash;there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must
    come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will
    take care to get good partners for them all."</p>

    <p>"I should like it beyond anything!" said her mother.</p>

    <p>"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get
    husbands for them before the winter is over."</p>

    <p>"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not particularly like your way of getting
    husbands."</p>

    <p>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he
    left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.</p>

    <p>No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting
    about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a
    family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.</p>

    <p>Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She
    had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had
    been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently
    caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary
    by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having
    a companion.</p>

    <p>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition
    with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September,
    than any body else in the country.</p>

    <p>One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:</p>

    <p>"Lizzy, I never gave <em>you</em> an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told mamma and the
    others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"</p>

    <p>"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject."</p>

    <p>"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement's,
    because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My
    uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came,
    and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should
    have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as
    if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of
    my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat."</p>

    <p>"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to
    understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe me, I did
    not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure
    London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the
    door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get
    together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me
    away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten
    minutes' time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the
    wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes!&mdash;he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have
    said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"</p>

    <p>"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no
    further."</p>

    <p>"Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions."</p>

    <p>"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."</p>

    <p>On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.</p>

    <p>But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for
    information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he
    had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried
    into her brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest
    light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short
    letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which
    had been intended.</p>

    <p>"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of
    us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write
    instantly, and let me understand it&mdash;unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which
    Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."</p>

    <p>"Not that I <em>shall</em>, though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do
    not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."</p>

    <p>Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall;
    Elizabeth was glad of it;&mdash;till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had
    rather be without a confidante.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no
    sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she
    sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
    contain a denial.</p>
