    <p>"I never heard that it was."</p>

    <p>"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?"</p>

    <p>"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions which I shall not choose
    to answer."</p>

    <p>"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of
    marriage?"</p>

    <p>"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."</p>

    <p>"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But your arts and allurements may, in
    a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn him
    in."</p>

    <p>"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."</p>

    <p>"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest
    relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."</p>

    <p>"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit."</p>

    <p>"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No,
    never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?"</p>

    <p>"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me."</p>

    <p>Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:</p>

    <p>"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other.
    It was the favourite wish of <em>his</em> mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union:
    and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a
    young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no
    regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
    propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your
    nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de
    Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy
    is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that
    choice, why may not I accept him?"</p>

    <p>"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be
    noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured,
    slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even
    be mentioned by any of us."</p>

    <p>"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources
    of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."</p>

    <p>"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is
    nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the
    determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any
    person's whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."</p>

    <p>"<em>That</em> will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on
    me."</p>

    <p>"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. They are
    descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and
    ancient&mdash;though untitled&mdash;families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each
    other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions
    of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If
    you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up."</p>

    <p>"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a
    gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal."</p>

    <p>"True. You <em>are</em> a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not
    imagine me ignorant of their condition."</p>

    <p>"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to
    <em>you</em>."</p>

    <p>"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"</p>

    <p>Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she
    could not but say, after a moment's deliberation:</p>

    <p>"I am not."</p>

    <p>Lady Catherine seemed pleased.</p>

    <p>"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"</p>

    <p>"I will make no promise of the kind."</p>

    <p>"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive
    yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I
    require."</p>

    <p>"And I certainly <em>never</em> shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.
    Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their
    marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him
    wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported
    this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my
    character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your
    interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
    therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."</p>

    <p>"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still
    another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement. I know it all;
    that the young man's marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is such a
    girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven
    and earth!&mdash;of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"</p>
