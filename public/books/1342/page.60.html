    <p>"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. <em>they</em> will take care not to outrun their
    income. <em>They</em> will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they
    often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever
    that happens."</p>

    <p>"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."</p>

    <p>"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves. Well,
    if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be ashamed of having
    one that was only entailed on me."</p>

    <h2>Chapter 41</h2>
    <p>The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment's stay in
    Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The
    elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.
    Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and
    who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.</p>

    <p>"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.
    "How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?"</p>

    <p>Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar
    occasion, five-and-twenty years ago.</p>

    <p>"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller's regiment went away. I thought I
    should have broken my heart."</p>

    <p>"I am sure I shall break <em>mine</em>," said Lydia.</p>

    <p>"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs. Bennet.</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes!&mdash;if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable."</p>

    <p>"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever."</p>

    <p>"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do <em>me</em> a great deal of good," added Kitty.</p>

    <p>Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted
    by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never
    had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.</p>

    <p>But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the
    wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman,
    and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other,
    and out of their <em>three</em> months' acquaintance they had been intimate <em>two</em>.</p>

    <p>The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the
    mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about
    the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence
    than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her
    accent was peevish.</p>

    <p>"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask <em>me</em> as well as Lydia," said she, "Though I am <em>not</em> her
    particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."</p>

    <p>In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself,
    this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it
    as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her
    were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the
    improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a
    woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where
    the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:</p>

    <p>"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect
    her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances."</p>

    <p>"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public
    notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner&mdash;nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would
    judge differently in the affair."</p>

    <p>"Already arisen?" repeated Mr. Bennet. "What, has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But
    do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a
    regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."</p>

    <p>"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of particular, but of general evils, which
    I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility, the
    assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my
    dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present
    pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will
    be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a
    flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable
    person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
    contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow
    wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it
    possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be
    often involved in the disgrace?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking her hand said in reply:</p>

    <p>"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and you
    will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of&mdash;or I may say, three&mdash;very silly sisters. We
    shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible
    man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At
    Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women
    better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. At any
    rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life."</p>
