    <p>"How nicely we are all crammed in," cried Lydia. "I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of
    having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in
    the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have
    you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will
    be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being
    married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had
    better have taken Mr. Collins; but <em>I</em> do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should
    like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a
    good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster
    promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are <em>such</em> friends!) and so
    she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what
    do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what
    fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to
    borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or
    three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I
    thought I should have died. And <em>that</em> made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was
    the matter."</p>

    <p>With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions,
    endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was
    no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.</p>

    <p>Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than
    once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:</p>

    <p>"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."</p>

    <p>Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and
    various were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of
    her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from
    Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a
    voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
    would hear her.</p>

    <p>"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up
    the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not
    been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with
    the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we
    came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And
    then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles
    off!"</p>

    <p>To this Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would
    doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for
    <em>me</em>&mdash;I should infinitely prefer a book."</p>

    <p>But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never
    attended to Mary at all.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went
    on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half
    a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded
    seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to <em>her</em> of the
    regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go&mdash;and once gone, she
    hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.</p>

    <p>She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a
    hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not
    the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother,
    though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 40</h2>
    <p>Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length,
    resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she
    related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.</p>

    <p>Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of
    Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr.
    Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she
    grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.</p>

    <p>"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong," said she, "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider
    how much it must increase his disappointment!"</p>

    <p>"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon
    drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"</p>

    <p>"Blame you! Oh, no."</p>

    <p>"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"</p>

    <p>"No&mdash;I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."</p>

    <p>"But you <em>will</em> know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day."</p>

    <p>She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a
    stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much
    wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's
    vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she
    labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one without involving the other.</p>
