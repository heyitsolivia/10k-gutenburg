    <p>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him
    capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane,
    and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there <em>with</em> his friend's permission, or being bold
    enough to come without it.</p>

    <p>"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired,
    without raising all this speculation! I <em>will</em> leave him to himself."</p>

    <p>In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival,
    Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than
    she had often seen them.</p>

    <p>The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought
    forward again.</p>

    <p>"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "you will wait on him of course."</p>

    <p>"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my
    daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."</p>

    <p>His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring
    gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.</p>

    <p>"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he. "If he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will
    not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again."</p>

    <p>"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan't
    prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make
    thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him."</p>

    <p>Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very
    mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before <em>they</em> did. As
    the day of his arrival drew near,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister. "It would be nothing; I could see him with
    perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well; but she
    does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield
    is over!"</p>

    <p>"I wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel
    it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so
    much."</p>

    <p>Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of
    it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted the days that
    must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after
    his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the
    house.</p>

    <p>Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but
    Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window&mdash;she looked,&mdash;she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat
    down again by her sister.</p>

    <p>"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"</p>

    <p>"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know."</p>

    <p>"La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That
    tall, proud man."</p>

    <p>"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!&mdash;and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome
    here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him."</p>

    <p>Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and
    therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after
    receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for
    themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as
    Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not
    be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own
    change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit
    she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were
    indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least
    as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming&mdash;at his coming to
    Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first
    witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.</p>

    <p>The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile
    of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still
    be unshaken. But she would not be secure.</p>

    <p>"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation."</p>

    <p>She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity
    carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little paler than
    usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she
    received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or
    any unnecessary complaisance.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness
    which it did not often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and, she
    thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he
    could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an
    improbable, conjecture.</p>

    <p>Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and
    embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
    especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.</p>
