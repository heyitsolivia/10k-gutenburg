    <p>Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter
    from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.</p>

    <p>Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without
    confusion, said scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had
    not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes
    elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity,
    she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object
    but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She
    was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.</p>

    <p>"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she. "Yet why did he come?"</p>

    <p>She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.</p>

    <p>She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.</p>

    <p>"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs. Bennet.</p>

    <p>He readily agreed to it.</p>

    <p>"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People <em>did</em> say you meant to quit the place entirely
    at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since
    you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it;
    indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in
    as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a
    syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too,
    and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?"</p>

    <p>Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy
    looked, therefore, she could not tell.</p>

    <p>"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same
    time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place
    quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose
    you have heard of his leaving the &mdash;&mdash;shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has
    <em>some</em> friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her
    seat. It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and
    she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.</p>

    <p>"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as
    many as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the
    best of the covies for you."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise
    at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same
    vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
    moments of such painful confusion.</p>

    <p>"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them. Their
    society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the
    other again!"</p>

    <p>Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material
    relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover. When first
    he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.
    He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.
    Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as
    much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.</p>

    <p>When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and
    engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.</p>

    <p>"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised
    to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very
    much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."</p>

    <p>Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by
    business. They then went away.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a
    very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had
    such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.</p>

    <p>As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without
    interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.</p>

    <p>"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?"</p>

    <p>She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.</p>

    <p>"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he
    fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more
    about him."</p>

    <p>Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a
    cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.</p>

    <p>"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall
    never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on
    both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."</p>
