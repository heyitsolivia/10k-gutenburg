    <p>Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him
    with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in
    an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.</p>

    <p>By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room
    again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a
    book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started
    back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books
    were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and
    before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:</p>

    <p>"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will
    hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to
    ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."</p>

    <p>Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book,
    and said:</p>

    <p>"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely
    for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as
    instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin."</p>

    <p>Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the
    challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet
    and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if
    he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should
    never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for
    backgammon.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 15</h2>
    <p>Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or
    society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and
    though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any
    useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility
    of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the
    consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine
    de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his
    veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman,
    and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and
    humility.</p>

    <p>Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with
    the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome
    and amiable as they were represented by common report. This was his plan of amends&mdash;of atonement&mdash;for
    inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and
    excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.</p>

    <p>His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his
    strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening <em>she</em> was his settled choice. The
    next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before
    breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that
    a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
    encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. "As to her <em>younger</em> daughters, she could not
    take upon her to say&mdash;she could not positively answer&mdash;but she did not <em>know</em> of any prepossession;
    her <em>eldest</em> daughter, she must just mention&mdash;she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very
    soon engaged."</p>

    <p>Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth&mdash;and it was soon done&mdash;done while Mrs. Bennet was
    stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom
    she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.</p>

    <p>Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and
    Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his
    library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally
    engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation,
    of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
    always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit
    in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt
    in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a
    walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.</p>

    <p>In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered
    Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were immediately
    wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really
    new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.</p>
