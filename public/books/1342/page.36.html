    <p>"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make
    allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's
    steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible
    match; and be ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our
    cousin."</p>

    <p>"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as
    this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding
    than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he
    is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of
    thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,
    change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is
    prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness."</p>

    <p>"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane; "and I hope you will be convinced of
    it by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned <em>two</em>
    instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking <em>that person</em>
    to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.
    We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own
    vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does."</p>

    <p>"And men take care that they should."</p>

    <p>"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the
    world as some persons imagine."</p>

    <p>"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to
    do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention
    to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business."</p>

    <p>"And do you impute it to either of those?"</p>

    <p>"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me
    whilst you can."</p>

    <p>"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."</p>

    <p>"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness; and if he is
    attached to me, no other woman can secure it."</p>

    <p>"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of
    wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections,
    and pride."</p>

    <p>"Beyond a doubt, they <em>do</em> wish him to choose Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better
    feelings than you are supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her
    better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's. What
    sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him
    attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
    affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I
    am not ashamed of having been mistaken&mdash;or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should
    feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be
    understood."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between
    them.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in
    which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less
    perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to
    Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though
    the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's
    best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.</p>

    <p>Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love, I find.
    I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something
    to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly
    bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young
    ladies in the country. Let Wickham be <em>your</em> man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune."</p>

    <p>"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an
    affectionate mother who will make the most of it."</p>

    <p>Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had
    thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of
    general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had
    suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much
    they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the matter.</p>

    <p>Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case,
    unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the
    possibility of mistakes&mdash;but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 25</h2>
    <p>After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable
    Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by
    preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into
    Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at
    Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their
    father another letter of thanks.</p>
