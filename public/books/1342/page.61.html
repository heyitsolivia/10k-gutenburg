    <p>With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him
    disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. She was
    confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part
    of her disposition.</p>

    <p>Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly
    have found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every
    possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place
    covered with officers. She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.
    She saw all the glories of the camp&mdash;its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with
    the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent,
    tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.</p>

    <p>Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been
    her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia's
    going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go
    there himself.</p>

    <p>But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to
    the very day of Lydia's leaving home.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been frequently in company with him since her
    return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to
    detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In
    his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon
    testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
    what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object
    of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained
    in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be
    gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.</p>

    <p>On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn;
    and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the
    manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both
    spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.</p>

    <p>He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that
    he had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had
    liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:</p>

    <p>"How long did you say he was at Rosings?"</p>

    <p>"Nearly three weeks."</p>

    <p>"And you saw him frequently?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, almost every day."</p>

    <p>"His manners are very different from his cousin's."</p>

    <p>"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance."</p>

    <p>"Indeed!" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. "And pray, may I ask?&mdash;" But checking
    himself, he added, in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to
    his ordinary style?&mdash;for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved
    in essentials."</p>

    <p>"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth. "In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was."</p>

    <p>While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their
    meaning. There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention,
    while she added:</p>

    <p>"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of
    improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."</p>

    <p>Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till,
    shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents:</p>

    <p>"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he
    is wise enough to assume even the <em>appearance</em> of what is right. His pride, in that direction, may be of
    service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered
    by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his
    visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated,
    I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de
    Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw
    that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest
    of the evening passed with the <em>appearance</em>, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to
    distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting
    again.</p>

    <p>When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the
    next morning. The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who
    shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of
    her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much
    as possible&mdash;advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous
    happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being
    heard.</p>
