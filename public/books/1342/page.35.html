    <p>Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so
    gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily
    for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day
    was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his
    absence before the family went to bed.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into
    an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was
    odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to
    see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr.
    Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her
    daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her
    husband.</p>

    <p>"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this
    house, that I should be forced to make way for <em>her</em>, and live to see her take her place in it!"</p>

    <p>"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I
    may be the survivor."</p>

    <p>This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as
    before.</p>

    <p>"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind
    it."</p>

    <p>"What should not you mind?"</p>

    <p>"I should not mind anything at all."</p>

    <p>"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."</p>

    <p>"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to
    entail away an estate from one's own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why
    should <em>he</em> have it more than anybody else?"</p>

    <p>"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 24</h2>
    <p>Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their
    being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay
    his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.</p>

    <p>Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the
    professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it.
    Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured
    to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great
    pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter
    with regard to new furniture.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart
    was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's assertion of her
    brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than
    she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly
    without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his
    designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own
    happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he
    thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in
    short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else; and yet
    whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been
    aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of
    him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally
    wounded.</p>

    <p>A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's
    leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help
    saying:</p>

    <p>"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her
    continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as
    we were before."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.</p>

    <p>"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed, you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most
    amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him
    with. Thank God! I have not <em>that</em> pain. A little time, therefore&mdash;I shall certainly try to get the
    better."</p>

    <p>With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error
    of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself."</p>

    <p>"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good. Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic;
    I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve."</p>

    <p>Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm
    affection.</p>

    <p>"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair. <em>You</em> wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I
    speak ill of anybody. I only want to think <em>you</em> perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of
    my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few
    people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I
    dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
    little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one
    I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!"</p>
