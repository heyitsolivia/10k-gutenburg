    <p>Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings
    towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full
    of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned
    against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude,
    his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel
    the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation
    and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of
    remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
    youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.
    Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while
    they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine,
    weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and
    Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there
    was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would
    be going there forever.</p>

    <p>Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all
    her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere,
    and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.
    How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so
    promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!</p>

    <p>When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the
    happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for
    her to appear tolerably cheerful.</p>

    <p>Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first. The
    very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey,
    gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the
    only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her
    trunk afresh.</p>

    <p>When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come
    to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to
    both.</p>

    <p>On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he
    took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.</p>

    <p>"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in
    coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. The favour of
    your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our
    plain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford
    extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and
    that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment;
    and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make <em>her</em> feel the
    obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:</p>

    <p>"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our
    best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our
    connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that
    your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is
    indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You
    see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this
    humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our
    intimacy at Rosings."</p>

    <p>Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while
    Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.</p>

    <p>"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at
    least that you will be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily
    witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate&mdash;but on this
    point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most
    cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.
    There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. We seem to have been
    designed for each other."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could
    add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital
    of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such
    society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she
    did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their
    dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.</p>
