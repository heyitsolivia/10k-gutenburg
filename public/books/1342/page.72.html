    <p>"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness
    to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was opened by a
    servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover
    himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your
    pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not
    an instant to lose."</p>

    <p>"Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will
    not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough; you
    cannot go yourself."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting
    to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made
    her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.</p>

    <p>On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was
    impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "Let me
    call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one?
    You are very ill."</p>

    <p>"No, I thank you," she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. "There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite
    well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."</p>

    <p>She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched
    suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length
    she spoke again. "I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone.
    My younger sister has left all her friends&mdash;has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of&mdash;of Mr.
    Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. <em>You</em> know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money,
    no connections, nothing that can tempt him to&mdash;she is lost for ever."</p>

    <p>Darcy was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," she added in a yet more agitated voice, "that I might have
    prevented it! I, who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only&mdash;some part of what I learnt, to
    my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all&mdash;all too late
    now."</p>

    <p>"I am grieved indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved&mdash;shocked. But is it certain&mdash;absolutely certain?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are
    certainly not gone to Scotland."</p>

    <p>"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"</p>

    <p>"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I
    hope, in half-an-hour. But nothing can be done&mdash;I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man to
    be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!"</p>

    <p>Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.</p>

    <p>"When <em>my</em> eyes were opened to his real character&mdash;Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared to do!
    But I knew not&mdash;I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!"</p>

    <p>Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation,
    his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking;
    everything <em>must</em> sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She
    could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom,
    afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
    wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.</p>

    <p>But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia&mdash;the humiliation, the misery she was
    bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth
    was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her
    situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise
    restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my
    stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part
    that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely
    to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you
    at Pemberley to-day."</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately.
    Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long."</p>

    <p>He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier
    conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one
    serious, parting look, went away.</p>

    <p>As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such
    terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over
    the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
    feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.</p>
