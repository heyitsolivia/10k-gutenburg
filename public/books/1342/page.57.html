    <p>At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be
    ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and
    as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his
    thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner,
    though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he
    suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the
    ladies at Rosings.</p>

    <p>"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful
    thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.</p>

    <p>"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came! and
    yet how many things have happened!"</p>

    <p>"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.</p>

    <p>"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! How much I shall have to tell!"</p>

    <p>Elizabeth added privately, "And how much I shall have to conceal!"</p>

    <p>Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving
    Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.</p>

    <p>Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements
    which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would
    be leisure enough for observation.</p>

    <p>It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of
    Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and
    must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was
    such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as
    to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried
    into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 39</h2>
    <p>It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the
    town of &mdash;&mdash;, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was
    to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a
    dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite
    milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.</p>

    <p>After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder
    usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?"</p>

    <p>"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia, "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the
    shop out there." Then, showing her purchases&mdash;"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very
    pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I
    can make it up any better."</p>

    <p>And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much
    uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be
    very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the &mdash;&mdash;shire have
    left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."</p>

    <p>"Are they indeed!" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.</p>

    <p>"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would
    be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all
    things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"</p>

    <p>"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "<em>that</em> would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once.
    Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of
    militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!"</p>

    <p>"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down at table. "What do you think? It is excellent
    news&mdash;capital news&mdash;and about a certain person we all like!"</p>

    <p>Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:</p>

    <p>"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I
    dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I
    never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter,
    is it not? There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at
    Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe."</p>

    <p>"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."</p>

    <p>"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."</p>

    <p>"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.</p>

    <p>"I am sure there is not on <em>his</em>. I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her&mdash;who
    could about such a nasty little freckled thing?"</p>

    <p>Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of <em>expression</em> herself, the
    coarseness of the <em>sentiment</em> was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!</p>

    <p>As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole
    party, with all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases,
    were seated in it.</p>
