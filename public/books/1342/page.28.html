    <p>Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the
    necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter
    settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she
    thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her
    of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for <em>her</em>, the worth of each was
    eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.</p>

    <p>The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it
    without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of
    diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all
    the observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the
    younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:</p>

    <p>"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a
    private audience with her in the course of this morning?"</p>

    <p>Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, "Oh
    dear!&mdash;yes&mdash;certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy&mdash;I am sure she can have no objection. Come,
    Kitty, I want you up stairs." And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called
    out:</p>

    <p>"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that
    anybody need not hear. I am going away myself."</p>

    <p>"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are." And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed
    and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: "Lizzy, I <em>insist</em> upon your staying and hearing Mr.
    Collins."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction&mdash;and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it
    would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by
    incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked
    off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began.</p>

    <p>"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your
    other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there <em>not</em> been this little unwillingness;
    but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt
    the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too
    marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life.
    But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my
    reasons for marrying&mdash;and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I
    certainly did."</p>

    <p>The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so
    near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he
    continued:</p>

    <p>"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances
    (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very
    greatly to my happiness; and thirdly&mdash;which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the
    particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has
    she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night
    before I left Hunsford&mdash;between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's
    footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a
    gentlewoman for <em>my</em> sake; and for your <em>own</em>, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up
    high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring
    her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the
    notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will
    find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her,
    especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my
    general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead
    of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as
    I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I
    could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be
    as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place&mdash;which, however, as I have already said, may not
    be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your
    esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my
    affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am
    well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be
    yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be
    uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are
    married."</p>

    <p>It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.</p>

    <p>"You are too hasty, sir," she cried. "You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of
    time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but
    it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them."</p>
