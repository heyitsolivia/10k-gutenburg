    <p>But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most
    gentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr.
    Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with
    the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the
    way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the
    pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and
    entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and
    he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man
    wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the
    best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up
    on his side by a happy readiness of conversation&mdash;a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
    unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses
    drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the
    group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal
    spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire
    after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth,
    when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of
    both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one
    looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat&mdash;a salutation which Mr. Darcy
    just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long
    to know.</p>

    <p>In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his
    friend.</p>

    <p>Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their
    bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips's
    throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly
    welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had
    not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the
    street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were
    come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She received him with
    her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous
    acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship
    to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good
    breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the
    other; of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from
    London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the &mdash;&mdash;shire. She had been watching him the
    last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would
    certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers, who,
    in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the
    Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation
    also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested that
    they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The
    prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his
    apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.</p>

    <p>As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane
    would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour
    than her sister.</p>

    <p>Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He
    protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only
    received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening,
    although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but
    yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 16</h2>
    <p>As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of
    leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed
    him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered
    the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.</p>

    <p>When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around
    him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might
    almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first
    convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its
    proprietor&mdash;when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
    that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would
    hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.</p>
