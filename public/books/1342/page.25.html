    <p>"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as
    soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly
    ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its
    <em>being created</em>."</p>

    <p>"I am," said he, with a firm voice.</p>

    <p>"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"</p>

    <p>"I hope not."</p>

    <p>"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at
    first."</p>

    <p>"May I ask to what these questions tend?"</p>

    <p>"Merely to the illustration of <em>your</em> character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. "I am
    trying to make it out."</p>

    <p>"And what is your success?"</p>

    <p>She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me
    exceedingly."</p>

    <p>"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could
    wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that
    the performance would reflect no credit on either."</p>

    <p>"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity."</p>

    <p>"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the
    other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's
    breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his
    anger against another.</p>

    <p>They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted
    her:</p>

    <p>"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about
    him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among his other
    communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a
    friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly
    false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy
    in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to
    blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not
    well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken
    himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he
    could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,
    considering his descent, one could not expect much better."</p>

    <p>"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you
    accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of <em>that</em>, I can assure you, he
    informed me himself."</p>

    <p>"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. "Excuse my interference&mdash;it was kindly
    meant."</p>

    <p>"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. "You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry
    attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy." She then sought her
    eldest sister, who has undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
    such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the
    occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham,
    resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for
    happiness.</p>

    <p>"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr.
    Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be
    sure of my pardon."</p>

    <p>"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not
    know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy;
    but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr.
    Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account
    as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent,
    and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"</p>

    <p>"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."</p>

    <p>"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the
    living?"</p>

    <p>"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he
    believes that it was left to him <em>conditionally</em> only."</p>

    <p>"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being
    convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is
    unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to
    still think of both gentlemen as I did before."</p>

    <p>She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of
    sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley's
    regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself,
    Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely
    replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate
    as to make a most important discovery.</p>

    <p>"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my
    patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the
    house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things
    occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I
    am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,
    and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my
    apology."</p>
