    <p>On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to
    spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as
    well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
    trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
    several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great
    favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular
    regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.</p>

    <p>The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest
    fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many
    grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of
    her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.</p>

    <p>"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister!
    It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it not been for her own
    perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas
    will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The
    Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but
    so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think
    of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very
    glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's
    correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
    conversation.</p>

    <p>When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. "It seems likely to have been a desirable
    match for Jane," said she. "I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you
    describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them,
    so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent."</p>

    <p>"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not do for <em>us</em>. We do not suffer by
    <em>accident</em>. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent
    fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."</p>

    <p>"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very
    little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong
    attachment. Pray, how <em>violent was</em> Mr. Bingley's love?"</p>

    <p>"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed
    by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young
    ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be
    finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, yes!&mdash;of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because,
    with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to <em>you</em>, Lizzy; you
    would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us?
    Change of scene might be of service&mdash;and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.</p>

    <p>"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live
    in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little,
    that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."</p>

    <p>"And <em>that</em> is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more
    suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps
    have <em>heard</em> of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to
    cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without
    him."</p>

    <p>"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his sister? <em>She</em>
    will not be able to help calling."</p>

    <p>"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."</p>

    <p>But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more
    interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced
    her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it
    probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more
    natural influence of Jane's attractions.</p>

    <p>Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at
    the same time, than as she hoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally
    spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.</p>

    <p>The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was
    not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and
    sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers
    always made part of it&mdash;of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs.
    Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,
    from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a
    little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to
    her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.</p>
