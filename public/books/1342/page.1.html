    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a
    wife.</p>

    <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth
    is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one
    or other of their daughters.</p>

    <p>"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>

    <p>"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."</p>

    <p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>

    <p>"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.</p>

    <p>"<em>You</em> want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."</p>

    <p>This was invitation enough.</p>

    <p>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the
    north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with
    it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his
    servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."</p>

    <p>"What is his name?"</p>

    <p>"Bingley."</p>

    <p>"Is he married or single?"</p>

    <p>"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing
    for our girls!"</p>

    <p>"How so? How can it affect them?"</p>

    <p>"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his
    marrying one of them."</p>

    <p>"Is that his design in settling here?"</p>

    <p>"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he <em>may</em> fall in love with one of them,
    and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."</p>

    <p>"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be
    still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party."</p>

    <p>"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly <em>have</em> had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything
    extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
    beauty."</p>

    <p>"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."</p>

    <p>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."</p>

    <p>"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."</p>

    <p>"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady
    Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you
    must go, for it will be impossible for <em>us</em> to visit him if you do not."</p>

    <p>"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few
    lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must
    throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."</p>

    <p>"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so
    handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving <em>her</em> the preference."</p>

    <p>"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls;
    but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Bennet, how <em>can</em> you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no
    compassion for my poor nerves."</p>

    <p>"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you
    mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least."</p>

    <p>"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."</p>

    <p>"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the
    neighbourhood."</p>

    <p>"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."</p>

    <p>"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."</p>

    <p>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of
    three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. <em>Her</em> mind was less
    difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was
    discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was
    visiting and news.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <p>Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though
    to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no
    knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a
    hat, he suddenly addressed her with:</p>

    <p>"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."</p>

    <p>"We are not in a way to know <em>what</em> Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to
    visit."</p>

    <p>"But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised
    to introduce him."</p>

    <p>"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical
    woman, and I have no opinion of her."</p>

    <p>"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her
    daughters.</p>

    <p>"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to
    pieces."</p>

    <p>"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill."</p>

    <p>"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully. "When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"</p>

    <p>"To-morrow fortnight."</p>

    <p>"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be
    impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."</p>

    <p>"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to <em>her</em>."</p>

    <p>"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?"</p>

    <p>"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man
    really is by the end of a fortnight. But if <em>we</em> do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long
    and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline
    the office, I will take it on myself."</p>
