    <p>"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build
    <em>your</em> house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley."</p>

    <p>"I wish it may."</p>

    <p>"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of
    model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire."</p>

    <p>"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."</p>

    <p>"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."</p>

    <p>"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon
    laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest
    sister, to observe the game.</p>

    <p>"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will she be as tall as I am?"</p>

    <p>"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller."</p>

    <p>"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such
    manners! And so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite."</p>

    <p>"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all
    are."</p>

    <p>"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who
    cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed
    that she was very accomplished."</p>

    <p>"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth. The word is applied to many
    a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing
    with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole
    range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished."</p>

    <p>"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.</p>

    <p>"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman."</p>

    <p>"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it."</p>

    <p>"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly
    surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and
    the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and
    manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved."</p>

    <p>"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the
    improvement of her mind by extensive reading."</p>

    <p>"I am no longer surprised at your knowing <em>only</em> six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing
    <em>any</em>."</p>

    <p>"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?"</p>

    <p>"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe
    united."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting
    that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints
    of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards
    left the room.</p>

    <p>"Elizabeth Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to
    recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in
    my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."</p>

    <p>"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is a meanness in <em>all</em> the
    arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
    despicable."</p>

    <p>Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley
    urged Mr. Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any
    service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she
    was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for
    early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
    declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could
    find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid
    to the sick lady and her sister.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able
    to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some
    time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she
    requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her
    situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied
    by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.</p>

    <p>Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on
    seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to
    health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of
    being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After
    sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
    attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet
    worse than she expected.</p>

    <p>"Indeed I have, sir," was her answer. "She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think
    of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."</p>
