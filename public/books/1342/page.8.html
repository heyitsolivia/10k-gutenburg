    <p>"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste,
    my love."</p>

    <p>"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.</p>

    "MY DEAR FRIEND,&mdash;
    <p>"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other
    for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as
    soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.&mdash;Yours
    ever,</p>

    "CAROLINE BINGLEY"
    <p>"With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of <em>that</em>."</p>

    <p>"Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."</p>

    <p>"Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.</p>

    <p>"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all
    night."</p>

    <p>"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her
    home."</p>

    <p>"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to
    theirs."</p>

    <p>"I had much rather go in the coach."</p>

    <p>"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they
    not?"</p>

    <p>"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."</p>

    <p>"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered."</p>

    <p>She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged
    to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes
    were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother
    was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.</p>

    <p>"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were
    all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was
    scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:</p>

    "MY DEAREST LIZZY,&mdash;
    <p>"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.
    My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.
    Jones&mdash;therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me&mdash;and, excepting a sore
    throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.&mdash;Yours, etc."</p>

    <p>"Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a
    dangerous fit of illness&mdash;if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr.
    Bingley, and under your orders."</p>

    <p>"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As
    long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she
    was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.</p>

    <p>"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit
    to be seen when you get there."</p>

    <p>"I shall be very fit to see Jane&mdash;which is all I want."</p>

    <p>"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?"</p>

    <p>"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I
    shall be back by dinner."</p>

    <p>"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by
    reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."</p>

    <p>"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the
    three young ladies set off together.</p>

    <p>"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he
    goes."</p>

    <p>In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth
    continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles
    with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings,
    and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.</p>

    <p>She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a
    great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by
    herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in
    contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was
    something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst
    nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her
    complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his
    breakfast.</p>

    <p>Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was
    very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane,
    who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she
    longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when
    Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary
    kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.</p>

    <p>When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw
    how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said,
    as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
    advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish
    symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other
    ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.</p>
