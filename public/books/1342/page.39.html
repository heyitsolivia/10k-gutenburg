    <p>Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote
    again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.</p>

    <p>Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in
    town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last
    letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.</p>

    <p>"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of
    calling in Grosvenor Street."</p>

    <p>She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. "I did not think Caroline in spirits,"
    were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.
    I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was
    well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to
    dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
    see them soon here."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her
    sister's being in town.</p>

    <p>Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret
    it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a
    fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of
    her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which
    she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt.</p>

    <p>"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I
    confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event
    has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my
    confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with
    me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not
    return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was
    very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a
    word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was
    perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very
    wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity
    her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother
    is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though <em>we</em> know this anxiety to be quite needless,
    yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister,
    whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any
    such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town,
    I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
    persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging
    harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will
    endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy&mdash;your affection, and the
    invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his
    never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention
    it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with
    Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.&mdash;Yours, etc."</p>

    <p>This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be
    duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for
    a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a
    possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's
    account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required
    information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His
    apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was
    watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but
    slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that <em>she</em> would have been his only choice, had
    fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady
    to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in
    Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural;
    and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and
    desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.</p>

    <p>All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: "I am now
    convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating
    passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only
    cordial towards <em>him</em>; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or
    that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
    watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances
    were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may
    sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young
    in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something
    to live on as well as the plain."</p>
