    <p>To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers. About ten or
    a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which
    he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the
    death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had
    been in the way of procuring.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well. Here consequently was
    an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which
    Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
    delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried
    to remember some of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was
    confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,
    ill-natured boy.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 26</h2>
    <p>Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of
    speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:</p>

    <p>"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I
    am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour
    to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
    <em>him</em>; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could
    not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to
    use it. Your father would depend on <em>your</em> resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your
    father."</p>

    <p>"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."</p>

    <p>"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."</p>

    <p>"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be
    in love with me, if I can prevent it."</p>

    <p>"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."</p>

    <p>"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But
    he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw&mdash;and if he becomes really attached to
    me&mdash;I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! <em>that</em> abominable Mr.
    Darcy! My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father,
    however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of
    you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate
    want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my
    fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise
    you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in
    company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not
    <em>remind</em> your mother of inviting him."</p>

    <p>"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain
    from <em>that</em>. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so
    frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.
    But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are
    satisfied."</p>

    <p>Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a
    wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.</p>

    <p>Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took
    up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast
    approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an
    ill-natured tone, that she "<em>wished</em> they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday
    Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious
    and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs
    together, Charlotte said:</p>

    <p>"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."</p>

    <p>"<em>That</em> you certainly shall."</p>

    <p>"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?"</p>

    <p>"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."</p>

    <p>"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.</p>

    <p>"My father and Maria are coming to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the
    party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them."</p>

    <p>The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much
    to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as
    regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
    address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a
    correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters were received
    with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she
    would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read,
    Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote
    cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture,
    neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It
    was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
    for her own visit there to know the rest.</p>
