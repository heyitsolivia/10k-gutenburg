    "E. GARDINER."
    <p>Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the &mdash;&mdash;shire as clearly
    as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North, just
    when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their
    residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken
    from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.</p>

    <p>"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of
    the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General &mdash;&mdash;'s
    regiment."</p>

    <p>His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set
    off for the North, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the
    sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged
    him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were
    married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the
    satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was
    banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to
    come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was
    surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination,
    any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 51</h2>
    <p>Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.
    The carriage was sent to meet them at &mdash;&mdash;, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their arrival
    was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have
    attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.</p>

    <p>They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet
    as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious,
    uneasy.</p>

    <p>Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped
    forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who
    followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.</p>

    <p>Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. His countenance rather
    gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to
    provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed,
    wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length
    they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a
    laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.</p>

    <p>Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his
    character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their
    relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance;
    but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She
    blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of
    colour.</p>

    <p>There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who
    happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured
    ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in
    the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters
    would not have alluded to for the world.</p>

    <p>"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and
    yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more
    idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was."</p>

    <p>Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never
    heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts
    know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was
    determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand
    just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them
    passing through the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade,
    walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you
    must go lower, because I am a married woman."</p>

    <p>It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at
    first. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other
    neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs. Wickham" by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner
    to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.</p>

    <p>"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband?
    Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They
    must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."</p>
