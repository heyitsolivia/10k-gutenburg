    <p>"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly
    acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as
    visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,"&mdash;recollecting herself&mdash;"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would
    have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them."</p>

    <p>This was a lucky recollection&mdash;it saved her from something very like regret.</p>

    <p>She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent, but had not the courage for it. At
    length however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied
    that he was, adding, "But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that
    their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!</p>

    <p>Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended,
    amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The
    housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward,
    who had been brought up by him at his own expense. "He is now gone into the army," she added; "but I am afraid he
    has turned out very wild."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.</p>

    <p>"And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master&mdash;and very like him. It
    was drawn at the same time as the other&mdash;about eight years ago."</p>

    <p>"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome
    face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.</p>

    <p>"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"</p>

    <p>Elizabeth coloured, and said: "A little."</p>

    <p>"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, very handsome."</p>

    <p>"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than
    this. This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was
    very fond of them."</p>

    <p>This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.</p>

    <p>"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mrs. Gardiner.</p>

    <p>"Oh! yes&mdash;the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!&mdash;She plays and sings all
    day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her&mdash;a present from my master; she comes here
    to-morrow with him."</p>

    <p>Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and
    remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his
    sister.</p>

    <p>"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"</p>

    <p>"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down
    for the summer months."</p>

    <p>"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."</p>

    <p>"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir; but I do not know when <em>that</em> will be. I do not know who is good enough for him."</p>

    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that
    you should think so."</p>

    <p>"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him," replied the other. Elizabeth thought this
    was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never known a
    cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."</p>

    <p>This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered
    man had been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to
    her uncle for saying:</p>

    <p>"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master."</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better. But I have always
    observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the
    sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth almost stared at her. "Can this be Mr. Darcy?" thought she.</p>

    <p>"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.</p>

    <p>"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him&mdash;just as affable to the poor."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other
    point. She related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in
    vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation
    of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded
    together up the great staircase.</p>

    <p>"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays,
    who think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name. Some
    people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
    away like other young men."</p>

    <p>"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.</p>

    <p>"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our
    poor friend."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps we might be deceived."</p>

    <p>"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."</p>

    <p>On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with
    greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give
    pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.</p>

    <p>"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room. "And this is always the way with
    him," she added. "Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he
    would not do for her."</p>

    <p>The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown. In the
    former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible
    below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually
    more interesting, and also more intelligible.</p>
