    <p>Elizabeth smiled.</p>

    <p>"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to
    enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly
    satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he
    is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man."</p>

    <p>"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."</p>

    <p>"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"</p>

    <p>"And how impossible in others!"</p>

    <p>"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"</p>

    <p>"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is
    not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante."</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 55</h2>
    <p>A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend had left him that morning for
    London, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.
    Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged
    elsewhere.</p>

    <p>"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."</p>

    <p>He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early
    opportunity of waiting on them.</p>

    <p>"Can you come to-morrow?"</p>

    <p>Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.</p>

    <p>He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her
    daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:</p>

    <p>"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come&mdash;Mr. Bingley is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make
    haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy's
    hair."</p>

    <p>"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she
    went up stairs half an hour ago."</p>

    <p>"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?"</p>

    <p>But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.</p>

    <p>The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the
    library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed,
    Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
    impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is
    the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such
    a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took
    her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her
    entreaty that <em>she</em> would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and called
    out:</p>

    <p>"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth was forced to go.</p>

    <p>"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother, as soon as she was in the hall. "Kitty and I
    are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were
    out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the
    professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening
    party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a
    forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.</p>

    <p>He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly
    through his own and Mrs. Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.</p>

    <p>After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley;
    but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within
    the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that
    gentleman's concurrence.</p>

    <p>Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.
    The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley
    that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric,
    than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's
    invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write,
    went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards,
    she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.</p>

    <p>But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was
    reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and
    Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,
    the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all. Their
    situation was awkward enough; but <em>hers</em> she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
    Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose,
    and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.</p>

    <p>Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her,
    acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.</p>

    <p>"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?"</p>
