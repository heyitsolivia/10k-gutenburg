    <p>Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet
    indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of
    encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air
    was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs.
    Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance
    fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in
    marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no
    compliments, answered most readily.</p>

    <p>"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, for else they will be destitute
    enough. Things are settled so oddly."</p>

    <p>"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate."</p>

    <p>"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault
    with <em>you</em>, for such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when
    once they come to be entailed."</p>

    <p>"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am
    cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire
    them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted&mdash;"</p>

    <p>He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of
    Mr. Collins's admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his
    commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing
    it all as his own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of
    his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him
    with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in
    the kitchen. He begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all
    offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 14</h2>
    <p>During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have
    some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing
    that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and
    consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was
    eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important
    aspect he protested that "he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank&mdash;such
    affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
    approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked
    him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the
    evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but <em>he</em> had never seen anything but
    affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest
    objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week
    or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he
    chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all
    the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself&mdash;some shelves in the closet
    up stairs."</p>

    <p>"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs. Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.
    It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?"</p>

    <p>"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's
    residence."</p>

    <p>"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?"</p>

    <p>"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property."</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is
    she? Is she handsome?"</p>

    <p>"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de
    Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young
    lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that
    progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who
    superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to
    drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."</p>

    <p>"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court."</p>

    <p>"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady
    Catherine one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the
    idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are
    always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed
    born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.
    These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself
    peculiarly bound to pay."</p>

    <p>"You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering
    with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result
    of previous study?"</p>

    <p>"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and
    arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as
    unstudied an air as possible."</p>
