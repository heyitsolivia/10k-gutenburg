    <p>"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong
    objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in
    London.</p>

    <p>"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she
    is!&mdash;her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could anything be
    urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and
    respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought of her mother, her confidence gave way a
    little; but she would not allow that any objections <em>there</em> had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride,
    she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from
    their want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of
    pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.</p>

    <p>The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards
    the evening, that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to
    Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to
    go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his
    apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 34</h2>
    <p>When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy,
    chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent.
    They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present
    suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used
    to characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed
    towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness,
    with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he
    had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to think that
    his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next&mdash;and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight
    she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that
    affection could do.</p>

    <p>She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel
    Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be
    unhappy about him.</p>

    <p>While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little
    fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and
    might now come to inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very
    differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he
    immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She
    answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room.
    Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated
    manner, and thus began:</p>

    <p>"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how
    ardently I admire and love you."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered
    sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He
    spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the
    subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority&mdash;of its being a degradation&mdash;of the
    family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the
    consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.</p>

    <p>In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection,
    and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till,
    roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose
    herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of
    that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his
    hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had
    no doubt of a favourable answer. He <em>spoke</em> of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real
    security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks,
    and she said:</p>

    <p>"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the
    sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I
    could <em>feel</em> gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot&mdash;I have never desired your good opinion, and
    you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most
    unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long
    prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this
    explanation."</p>

    <p>Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words
    with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was
    visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he
    believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful. At length, with a voice of
    forced calmness, he said:</p>
