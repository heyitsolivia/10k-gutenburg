    <p>In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of
    his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined
    them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what
    she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could
    not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own
    indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last,
    however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither
    been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers
    of the &mdash;&mdash;shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the
    present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as <em>they</em> were
    superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.</p>

    <p>Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman
    by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though
    it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be
    rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.</p>

    <p>With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into
    insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs.
    Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were
    placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.</p>

    <p>"I know little of the game at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in
    life&mdash;" Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.</p>

    <p>Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth
    and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker;
    but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in
    making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands
    of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though
    what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told&mdash;the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.
    She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the
    subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a
    hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.</p>

    <p>"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large
    property in Derbyshire, I understand."</p>

    <p>"Yes," replied Mr. Wickham; "his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have
    met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been connected
    with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth could not but look surprised.</p>

    <p>"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold
    manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?"</p>

    <p>"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth very warmly. "I have spent four days in the same house with him,
    and I think him very disagreeable."</p>

    <p>"I have no right to give <em>my</em> opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not
    qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for <em>me</em> to
    be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish&mdash;and perhaps you would not express it
    quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your own family."</p>

    <p>"Upon my word, I say no more <em>here</em> than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.
    He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more
    favourably spoken of by anyone."</p>

    <p>"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be
    estimated beyond their deserts; but with <em>him</em> I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his
    fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be
    seen."</p>

    <p>"I should take him, even on <em>my</em> slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his
    head.</p>

    <p>"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much
    longer."</p>

    <p>"I do not at all know; but I <em>heard</em> nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans
    in favour of the &mdash;&mdash;shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."</p>

    <p>"Oh! no&mdash;it is not for <em>me</em> to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If <em>he</em> wishes to avoid seeing
    <em>me</em>, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason
    for avoiding <em>him</em> but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most
    painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that
    ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being
    grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily
    believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
    memory of his father."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it
    prevented further inquiry.</p>

    <p>Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly
    pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.</p>
