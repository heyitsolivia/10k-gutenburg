    <p>"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our
    coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their
    brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly went&mdash;and there I readily
    engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced
    them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose
    that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not
    in giving, of your sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not
    with equal regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
    own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against
    returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame
    myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect
    with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your
    sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of
    it. That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough
    extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is
    done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.
    If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
    you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.</p>

    <p>"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by
    laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has <em>particularly</em> accused me I am
    ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley
    estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him;
    and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at
    school, and afterwards at Cambridge&mdash;most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the
    extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of
    this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the
    church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I
    first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities&mdash;the want of principle, which
    he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of
    nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy
    could not have. Here again I shall give you pain&mdash;to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the
    sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real
    character&mdash;it adds even another motive.</p>

    <p>"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that
    in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession
    might allow&mdash;and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became
    vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a
    year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped
    I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the
    preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be
    aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than
    believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham
    ought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settled&mdash;he resigned all claim to assistance in
    the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
    thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to
    Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere
    pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three
    years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he
    applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in
    believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved
    on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question&mdash;of which he trusted there could be little
    doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered
    father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every
    repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances&mdash;and he was doubtless
    as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of
    acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my
    notice.</p>
