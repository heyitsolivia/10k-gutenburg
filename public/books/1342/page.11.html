    <p>"Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal."</p>

    <p>"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet will receive every
    possible attention while she remains with us."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.</p>

    <p>"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is
    very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way
    with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they
    are nothing to <em>her</em>. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I
    do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I
    hope, though you have but a short lease."</p>

    <p>"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should
    probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."</p>

    <p>"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.</p>

    <p>"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.</p>

    <p>"Oh! yes&mdash;I understand you perfectly."</p>

    <p>"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."</p>

    <p>"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a
    one as yours."</p>

    <p>"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to
    do at home."</p>

    <p>"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character. It must be an
    amusing study."</p>

    <p>"Yes, but intricate characters are the <em>most</em> amusing. They have at least that advantage."</p>

    <p>"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood
    you move in a very confined and unvarying society."</p>

    <p>"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever."</p>

    <p>"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. "I assure you
    there is quite as much of <em>that</em> going on in the country as in town."</p>

    <p>Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who
    fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.</p>

    <p>"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public
    places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?"</p>

    <p>"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the
    same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."</p>

    <p>"Aye&mdash;that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to
    think the country was nothing at all."</p>

    <p>"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only
    meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must
    acknowledge to be true."</p>

    <p>"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I
    believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families."</p>

    <p>Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and
    directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that
    might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since <em>her</em> coming
    away.</p>

    <p>"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much
    the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. <em>That</em> is my idea of good
    breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the
    matter."</p>

    <p>"Did Charlotte dine with you?"</p>

    <p>"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep
    servants that can do their own work; <em>my</em> daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge
    for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not
    that I think Charlotte so <em>very</em> plain&mdash;but then she is our particular friend."</p>

    <p>"She seems a very pleasant young woman."</p>

    <p>"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's
    beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane&mdash;one does not often see anybody better
    looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at
    my brother Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer
    before we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on
    her, and very pretty they were."</p>

    <p>"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. "There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the
    same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"</p>

    <p>"I have been used to consider poetry as the <em>food</em> of love," said Darcy.</p>

    <p>"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight,
    thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."</p>

    <p>Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing
    herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began
    repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr.
    Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the
    occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon
    afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls
    had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr.
    Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.</p>
