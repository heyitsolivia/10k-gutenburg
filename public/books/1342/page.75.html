    <p>When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated
    by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which
    the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and
    that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and,
    perhaps, announce their marriage.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes' conversation together, received them
    exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of
    Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging
    indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing.</p>

    <p>"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point in going to Brighton, with all my family, <em>this</em> would
    not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of
    their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do
    such a thing if she had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but
    I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight
    Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn
    us out before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do."</p>

    <p>They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for
    her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in
    every endeavour for recovering Lydia.</p>

    <p>"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he; "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no
    occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we may gain
    some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give
    the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to
    Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done."</p>

    <p>"Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get
    to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, <em>make</em> them marry. And as
    for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to
    buy them, after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am
    in, that I am frighted out of my wits&mdash;and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me&mdash;such
    spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And
    tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which
    are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."</p>

    <p>But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid
    recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till
    dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence
    of her daughters.</p>

    <p>Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the
    family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before
    the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that <em>one</em> only of the household, and the one
    whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.</p>

    <p>In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate
    apartments to make their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of
    both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite
    sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than usual to
    the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of
    grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:</p>

    <p>"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and
    pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation."</p>

    <p>Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we
    may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false step involves
    her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much
    guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued
    to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth
    instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After
    joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but
    certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, "But
    tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel
    Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together
    for ever."</p>

    <p>"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to
    give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He <em>was</em>
    coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when
    that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey."</p>

    <p>"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel
    Forster seen Denny himself?"</p>
