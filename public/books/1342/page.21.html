    <p>"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter
    the &mdash;&mdash;shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further
    by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had
    procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear
    solitude. I <em>must</em> have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but
    circumstances have now made it eligible. The church <em>ought</em> to have been my profession&mdash;I was brought up
    for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the
    gentleman we were speaking of just now."</p>

    <p>"Indeed!"</p>

    <p>"Yes&mdash;the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my
    godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
    and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."</p>

    <p>"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could <em>that</em> be? How could his will be disregarded? Why did you
    not seek legal redress?"</p>

    <p>"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour
    could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it&mdash;or to treat it as a merely conditional
    recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence&mdash;in short
    anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold
    it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really
    done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my opinion <em>of</em>
    him, and <em>to</em> him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of
    men, and that he hates me."</p>

    <p>"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced."</p>

    <p>"Some time or other he <em>will</em> be&mdash;but it shall not be by <em>me</em>. Till I can forget his father, I can
    never defy or expose <em>him</em>."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.</p>

    <p>"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive? What can have induced him to behave so
    cruelly?"</p>

    <p>"A thorough, determined dislike of me&mdash;a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.
    Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment
    to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we
    stood&mdash;the sort of preference which was often given me."</p>

    <p>"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this&mdash;though I have never liked him. I had not thought so very ill of
    him. I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to
    such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this."</p>

    <p>After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, "I <em>do</em> remember his boasting one day, at
    Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be
    dreadful."</p>

    <p>"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham; "I can hardly be just to him."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner the godson, the
    friend, the favourite of his father!" She could have added, "A young man, too, like <em>you</em>, whose very
    countenance may vouch for your being amiable"&mdash;but she contented herself with, "and one, too, who had probably
    been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"</p>

    <p>"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together;
    inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. <em>My</em> father began
    life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to&mdash;but he gave up
    everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was
    most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be
    under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence, and when, immediately before my father's
    death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a
    debt of gratitude to <em>him</em>, as of his affection to myself."</p>

    <p>"How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him
    just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest&mdash;for dishonesty I
    must call it."</p>

    <p>"It <em>is</em> wonderful," replied Wickham, "for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had
    often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are none of
    us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride."</p>

    <p>"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?"</p>

    <p>"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to
    assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and <em>filial</em> pride&mdash;for he is very proud of what
    his father was&mdash;have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities,
    or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also <em>brotherly</em> pride, which, with
    <em>some</em> brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him
    generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."</p>

    <p>"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?"</p>

    <p>He shook his head. "I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too
    much like her brother&mdash;very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of
    me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about
    fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her home has been London,
    where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education."</p>
