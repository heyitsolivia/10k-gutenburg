    <p>If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither
    improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise&mdash;if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in
    comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words
    have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter
    method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less
    interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what
    Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since
    reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she
    thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development.
    While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise&mdash;all astonishment that
    Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached
    him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have
    sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the
    intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would
    preserve her from falling an easy prey.</p>

    <p>She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she
    was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes
    another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been
    fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a
    girl&mdash;oh! how acutely did she now feel it!</p>

    <p>She was wild to be at home&mdash;to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must
    now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring
    constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference
    seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had
    hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying
    them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and
    dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy, though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr.
    and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the
    first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though
    expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything
    relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. "But what is to be done
    about Pemberley?" cried Mrs. Gardiner. "John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?"</p>

    <p>"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. <em>That</em> is all settled."</p>

    <p>"What is all settled?" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare. "And are they upon such terms as
    for her to disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!"</p>

    <p>But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.
    Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one
    so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes
    to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw
    the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done
    but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she
    could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.</p>

    <p>"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon
    serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter. It
    appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means
    unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope
    the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
    regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk!"</p>

    <p>"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.</p>

    <p>"Upon my word," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion. It is really too great a violation of
    decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself,
    Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"</p>

    <p>"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed,
    it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?"</p>

    <p>"In the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland."</p>

    <p>"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of
    them were to be found on the Barnet road."</p>

    <p>"Well, then&mdash;supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for
    no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike
    them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland."</p>

    <p>"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no&mdash;this
    is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry
    her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia&mdash;what
    attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of
    benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on
    a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might
    produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step
    forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
    seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that <em>he</em> would do as little, and think as little about
    it, as any father could do, in such a matter."</p>
