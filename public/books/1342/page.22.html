    <p>After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first,
    and saying:</p>

    <p>"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I
    really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr.
    Bingley?"</p>

    <p>"Not at all."</p>

    <p>"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is."</p>

    <p>"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want abilities. He can be a conversible
    companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very
    different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is
    liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable&mdash;allowing something for fortune and
    figure."</p>

    <p>The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his
    station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success was made by the
    latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern
    thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the
    money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make herself uneasy.</p>

    <p>"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of
    these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly
    many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of
    regarding little matters."</p>

    <p>Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a
    low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.</p>

    <p>"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was
    first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long."</p>

    <p>"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt
    to the present Mr. Darcy."</p>

    <p>"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections. I never heard of her existence
    till the day before yesterday."</p>

    <p>"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will
    unite the two estates."</p>

    <p>This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her
    attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
    self-destined for another.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that
    he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness,
    she is an arrogant, conceited woman."</p>

    <p>"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very
    well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of
    being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and
    fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone
    connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with
    mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's
    attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended
    him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with
    her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home;
    but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once
    silent. Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr.
    Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his
    losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more
    to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with
    astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard;
    and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The
    possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing
    remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the
    account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.</p>

    <p>"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.
    Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture
    the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."</p>

    <p>"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have
    probably been concerned in the business? Do clear <em>them</em> too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
    somebody."</p>

    <p>"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in
    what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner, one whom his
    father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
    character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no."</p>

    <p>"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a
    history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so,
    let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks."</p>
