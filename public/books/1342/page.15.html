    <p>"But upon my honour, I do <em>not</em>. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me <em>that</em>. Tease
    calmness of manner and presence of mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose
    ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will
    continue, for it would be a great loss to <em>me</em> to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh."</p>

    <p>"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me more credit than can be. The wisest and the best of men&mdash;nay, the
    wisest and best of their actions&mdash;may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
    joke."</p>

    <p>"Certainly," replied Elizabeth&mdash;"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of <em>them</em>. I hope I
    never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, <em>do</em> divert me, I own,
    and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which
    often expose a strong understanding to ridicule."</p>

    <p>"Such as vanity and pride."</p>

    <p>"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride&mdash;where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be
    always under good regulation."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.</p>

    <p>"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley; "and pray what is the result?"</p>

    <p>"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise."</p>

    <p>"No," said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of
    understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding&mdash;certainly too little for
    the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses
    against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called
    resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever."</p>

    <p>"<em>That</em> is a failing indeed!" cried Elizabeth. "Implacable resentment <em>is</em> a shade in a character. But
    you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot <em>laugh</em> at it. You are safe from me."</p>

    <p>"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil&mdash;a natural defect, which not
    even the best education can overcome."</p>

    <p>"And <em>your</em> defect is to hate everybody."</p>

    <p>"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is willfully to misunderstand them."</p>

    <p>"Do let us have a little music," cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. "Louisa,
    you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?"</p>

    <p>Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments'
    recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>
    <p>In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that
    the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters
    remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself
    to receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes,
    for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before
    Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she
    could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved&mdash;nor did she
    much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly
    long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original
    design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.</p>

    <p>The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till
    the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that
    she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the
    other.</p>

    <p>The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade
    Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her&mdash;that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she
    felt herself to be right.</p>

    <p>To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence&mdash;Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him
    more than he liked&mdash;and Miss Bingley was uncivil to <em>her</em>, and more teasing than usual to himself. He
    wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should <em>now</em> escape him, nothing that
    could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his
    behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he
    scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves
    for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.</p>

    <p>On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility
    to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring
    the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her
    most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of
    spirits.</p>

    <p>They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought
    them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their father, though
    very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family
    circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its
    sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.</p>

    <p>They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire,
    and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a
    different sort. Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of
    the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that
    Colonel Forster was going to be married.</p>
