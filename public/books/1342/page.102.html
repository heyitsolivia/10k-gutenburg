    <p>Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine
    frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very
    abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's
    persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further
    resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to
    see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution
    which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt
    from the city.</p>

    <p>With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them;
    and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire,
    had been the means of uniting them.</p>
