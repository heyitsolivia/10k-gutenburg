    <p>Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which
    was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's
    entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be
    advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction
    as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.</p>

    <p>"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?" she cried. "Sure he will not leave London before he has found
    them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"</p>

    <p>As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at
    the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and
    brought its master back to Longbourn.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her
    from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of
    half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.
    Elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.</p>

    <p>The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary;
    nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from <em>that</em>, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably
    well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have
    borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of
    two.</p>

    <p>When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. He said as little as he
    had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time
    before his daughters had courage to speak of it.</p>

    <p>It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject;
    and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that. Who
    should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it."</p>

    <p>"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.</p>

    <p>"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in
    my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass
    away soon enough."</p>

    <p>"Do you suppose them to be in London?"</p>

    <p>"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"</p>

    <p>"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.</p>

    <p>"She is happy then," said her father drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration."</p>

    <p>Then after a short silence he continued:</p>

    <p>"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event,
    shows some greatness of mind."</p>

    <p>They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.</p>

    <p>"This is a parade," he cried, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will
    do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or,
    perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away."</p>

    <p>"I am not going to run away, papa," said Kitty fretfully. "If I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better
    than Lydia."</p>

    <p>"<em>You</em> go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at
    last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again,
    nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your
    sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a
    rational manner."</p>

    <p>Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.</p>

    <p>"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take
    you to a review at the end of them."</p>

    <h2>Chapter 49</h2>
    <p>Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the
    house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother,
    went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet,
    "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so
    I took the liberty of coming to ask."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town."</p>

    <p>"Dear madam," cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from
    Mr. Gardiner? He has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter."</p>

    <p>Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They ran through the vestibule into the
    breakfast-room; from thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him
    up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said:</p>

    <p>"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse."</p>

    <p>Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their
    father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.</p>

    <p>Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her
    sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:</p>

    <p>"Oh, papa, what news&mdash;what news? Have you heard from my uncle?"</p>

    <p>"Yes I have had a letter from him by express."</p>

    <p>"Well, and what news does it bring&mdash;good or bad?"</p>

    <p>"What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket. "But perhaps you would like
    to read it."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.</p>

    <p>"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is about."</p>

    <p>"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.</p>

    "MY DEAR BROTHER,
    <p>"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you
    satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they
    were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen them
    both&mdash;"</p>
