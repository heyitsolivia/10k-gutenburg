    <p>"You can now have nothing further to say," she resentfully answered. "You have insulted me in every possible
    method. I must beg to return to the house."</p>

    <p>And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.</p>

    <p>"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider
    that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"</p>

    <p>"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments."</p>

    <p>"You are then resolved to have him?"</p>

    <p>"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute
    my happiness, without reference to <em>you</em>, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."</p>

    <p>"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You
    are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."</p>

    <p>"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present
    instance. No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment
    of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former <em>were</em> excited by his marrying me, it would not
    give me one moment's concern&mdash;and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."</p>

    <p>"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not
    imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable;
    but, depend upon it, I will carry my point."</p>

    <p>In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round,
    she added, "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such
    attention. I am most seriously displeased."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked
    quietly into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met
    her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.</p>

    <p>"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."</p>

    <p>"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to
    tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought
    she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"</p>

    <p>Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation
    was impossible.</p>

    <p>The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome;
    nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually
    taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with
    Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate,
    Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that <em>his</em> being the intimate friend of Bingley, and
    <em>her</em> being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager
    for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring
    them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with
    the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set that down as almost certain and
    immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time.</p>

    <p>In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible
    consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their
    marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how <em>he</em> might take
    a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the
    exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he
    thought much higher of her ladyship than <em>she</em> could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries
    of a marriage with <em>one</em>, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on
    his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had
    appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.</p>

    <p>If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of
    so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could
    make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his
    engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.</p>

    <p>"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I
    shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is
    satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret
    him at all."</p>

    <hr>
    <p>The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they
    obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth
    was spared from much teasing on the subject.</p>

    <p>The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a
    letter in his hand.</p>

    <p>"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."</p>

    <p>She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of
    its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady
    Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.</p>

    <p>She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He then said,</p>

    <p>"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself,
    you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me
    congratulate you on a very important conquest."</p>
