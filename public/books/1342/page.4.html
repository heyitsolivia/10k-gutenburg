    <p>"Certainly not&mdash;at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to
    live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in
    her."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to
    please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a
    judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in
    fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves
    agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the
    first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than
    they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of
    themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more
    deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.</p>

    <p>Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had
    intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made
    choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to
    many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at
    Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.</p>

    <p>His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a
    tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table&mdash;nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a
    man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley
    had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He
    did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour&mdash;was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
    with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.</p>

    <p>Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was
    endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a
    greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's
    regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the
    superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
    fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the
    advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.</p>

    <p>The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met
    with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there
    had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could
    not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was
    little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either
    attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so&mdash;but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her
    to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a
    sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <p>Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William
    Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of
    knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It
    had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he
    had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he
    could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil
    to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all
    attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him
    courteous.</p>

    <p>Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had
    several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's
    intimate friend.</p>

    <p>That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the
    morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.</p>

    <p>"<em>You</em> began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.
    "<em>You</em> were Mr. Bingley's first choice."</p>

    <p>"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better."</p>

    <p>"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be sure that <em>did</em> seem as if he admired
    her&mdash;indeed I rather believe he <em>did</em>&mdash;I heard something about it&mdash;but I hardly know
    what&mdash;something about Mr. Robinson."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's
    asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in
    the room, and <em>which</em> he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the
    eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'"</p>

    <p>"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed&mdash;that does seem as if&mdash;but, however, it may all come
    to nothing, you know."</p>

    <p>"<em>My</em> overhearings were more to the purpose than <em>yours</em>, Eliza," said Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not so
    well worth listening to as his friend, is he?&mdash;poor Eliza!&mdash;to be only just <em>tolerable</em>."</p>
