    <p>"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes
    and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?"</p>

    <p>"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?"</p>

    <p>"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really
    liked him."</p>

    <p>"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is
    perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such
    terms."</p>

    <p>"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never
    dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to <em>you</em>, if you are resolved on having him.
    But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy
    nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively
    talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and
    misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing <em>you</em> unable to respect your partner in life. You know
    not what you are about."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that
    Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had
    undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of
    many months' suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity,
    and reconcile him to the match.</p>

    <p>"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you.
    I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy."</p>

    <p>To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard
    her with astonishment.</p>

    <p>"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid
    the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy.
    Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and <em>would</em> have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every
    thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there
    will be an end of the matter."</p>

    <p>He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing
    at her some time, allowed her at last to go&mdash;saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come for Mary
    or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."</p>

    <p>Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own
    room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the
    evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and
    familiarity would come in time.</p>

    <p>When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication.
    Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a
    syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general
    backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.
    She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless
    herself.</p>

    <p>"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true?
    Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will
    have! Jane's is nothing to it&mdash;nothing at all. I am so pleased&mdash;so happy. Such a charming man!&mdash;so
    handsome! so tall!&mdash;Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will
    overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand
    a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted."</p>

    <p>This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion
    was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother
    followed her.</p>

    <p>"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as
    good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell
    me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow."</p>

    <p>This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that,
    though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still
    something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
    in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer
    him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon
    assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.</p>

    <p>"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he. "Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like
    <em>your</em> husband quite as well as Jane's."</p>

    <h2>Chapter 60</h2>
    <p>Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen
    in love with her. "How could you begin?" said she. "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once
    made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"</p>

    <p>"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago.
    I was in the middle before I knew that I <em>had</em> begun."</p>

    <p>"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners&mdash;my behaviour to <em>you</em> was at least always
    bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;
    did you admire me for my impertinence?"</p>
