    <p>Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly
    express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay
    with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present.</p>

    <p>"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried. "I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate
    solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that
    what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"</p>

    <p>She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with
    Kitty.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled,
    that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.</p>

    <p>"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and
    contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"</p>

    <p>In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the
    purpose.</p>

    <p>"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.</p>

    <p>"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say."</p>

    <p>He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth
    honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great
    cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of
    Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to
    be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
    Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.</p>

    <p>It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such
    sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was
    coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her
    feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper,
    his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was.</p>

    <p>Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as
    soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:</p>

    <p>"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman."</p>

    <p>Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.</p>

    <p>"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have
    not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying,
    that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
    always exceed your income."</p>

    <p>"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me."</p>

    <p>"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five
    thousand a year, and very likely more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am
    sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was
    sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into
    Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young
    man that ever was seen!"</p>

    <p>Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared
    for no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in
    future be able to dispense.</p>

    <p>Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every
    winter.</p>

    <p>Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and
    always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had
    given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no
    attention to bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of
    separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the
    pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.</p>

    <p>"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town
    last spring! I had not believed it possible."</p>

    <p>"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth. "But how did he account for it?"</p>

    <p>"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot
    wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust
    they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms
    again; though we can never be what we once were to each other."</p>

    <p>"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me,
    indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."</p>

    <p>"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a
    persuasion of <em>my</em> being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!"</p>

    <p>"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."</p>

    <p>This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good
    qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane
    had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her
    against him.</p>

    <p>"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried Jane. "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled
    from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see <em>you</em> as happy! If there <em>were</em> but such
    another man for you!"</p>
