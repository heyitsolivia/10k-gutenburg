    <p>If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had
    been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers
    than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and
    practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination,
    warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies. It is even possible that the train of my
    ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance my father had taken of
    my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest
    avidity. When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of
    Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to
    me treasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent
    longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern
    philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed
    that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors
    in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy's apprehensions as tyros
    engaged in the same pursuit.</p>

    <p>The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses. The most
    learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were
    still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomize, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause,
    causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and
    impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had
    repined.</p>

    <p>But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took their word for all that
    they averred, and I became their disciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century;
    but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with
    regard to my favourite studies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child's blindness,
    added to a student's thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest
    diligence into the search of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my
    undivided attention. Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish
    disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death! Nor were these my only visions.
    The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I
    most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own
    inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was occupied
    by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a
    very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident
    again changed the current of my ideas. When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive,
    when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the
    thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm
    lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of
    fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling
    light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next
    morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced
    to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.</p>

    <p>Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great
    research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a
    theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.
    All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my
    imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It
    seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
    despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave
    up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and
    entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of real
    knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that
    science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.</p>

    <p>Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I
    look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion
    of the guardian angel of my life&mdash;the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that
    was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and
    gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I
    was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.</p>

    <p>It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and her immutable
    laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.</p>
