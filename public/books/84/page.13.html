    <p>But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.
    My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more
    particularly than before. Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom
    or the expanding leaves&mdash;sights which before always yielded me supreme delight&mdash;so deeply was I engrossed
    in my occupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed
    me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like
    one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite
    employment. Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of
    a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed
    at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end,
    and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of
    these when my creation should be complete.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 5</h2>
    <p>It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost
    amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the
    lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes,
    and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye
    of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.</p>

    <p>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and
    care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful.
    Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a
    lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid
    contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were
    set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.</p>

    <p>The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for
    nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of
    rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the
    beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the
    being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose
    my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in
    my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was
    disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of
    Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became
    livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother
    in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started
    from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed;
    when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the
    wretch&mdash;the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they
    may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled
    his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I
    escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I
    remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively,
    catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so
    miserably given life.</p>

    <p>Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy again endued with animation could not be so
    hideous as that wretch. I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints
    were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.</p>

    <p>I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every
    artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I
    felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now
    become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!</p>

    <p>Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of
    Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates of the court,
    which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to
    avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view. I did not dare return to the
    apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black
    and comfortless sky.</p>

    <p>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed
    upon my mind. I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing. My heart
    palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:</p>

    <p class="poem">Like one who, on a lonely road,Doth walk in fear and dread,And, having once turned round, walks
    on,And turns no more his head;Because he knows a frightful fiendDoth close behind him tread.[Coleridge's "Ancient
    Mariner."]</p>

    <p>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually
    stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming
    towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it
    stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,
    instantly sprung out. "My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed he, "how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should
    be here at the very moment of my alighting!"</p>
