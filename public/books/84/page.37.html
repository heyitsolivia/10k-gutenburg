    <p>"And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I resolved to fly far from the scene of my
    misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the thought of you
    crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more
    fitness than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie, geography had not
    been omitted; I had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth. You had
    mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards this place I resolved to proceed.</p>

    <p>"But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination,
    but the sun was my only guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could I ask
    information from a single human being; but I did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although
    towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! You had endowed me with
    perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But on you only had
    I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain
    from any other being that wore the human form.</p>

    <p>"My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was late in autumn when I quitted the district
    where I had so long resided. I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being. Nature
    decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the
    surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh, earth! How often did I imprecate
    curses on the cause of my being! The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and
    bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled
    in my heart. Snow fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents now and then directed me,
    and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me no
    respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that
    happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again
    began to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.</p>

    <p>"I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man. One
    morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had
    risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the
    balminess of the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me.
    Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and forgetting my
    solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with
    thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.</p>

    <p>"I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and
    rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring. Here I paused, not
    exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the
    shade of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed,
    laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river,
    when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme
    labour, from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She was senseless, and I endeavoured by
    every means in my power to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was
    probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from
    my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw
    me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my injurer, with
    increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.</p>

    <p>"This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I
    now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of kindness and
    gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.
    Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the agony of my wound overcame me; my
    pulses paused, and I fainted.</p>

    <p>"For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received. The
    ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no
    means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude
    of their infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge&mdash;a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate
    for the outrages and anguish I had endured.</p>

    <p>"After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The labours I endured were no longer to be
    alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state
    and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.</p>

    <p>"But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva.</p>

    <p>"It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in
    what manner I should apply to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle
    breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.</p>

    <p>"At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a
    beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I
    gazed on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have
    imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should
    not be so desolate in this peopled earth.</p>
