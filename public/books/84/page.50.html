    <p>Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair. It was
    necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and
    to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to
    blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which I
    had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to delay our departure, fearful
    that I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered wreck&mdash;the shadow of a human being.
    My strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame. Still, as I urged
    our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on
    board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores. It was midnight. I lay on
    the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland
    from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva. The past
    appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the
    detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and
    that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I repassed,
    in my memory, my whole life&mdash;my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my
    mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the
    creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the
    train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly. Ever since my recovery from the fever I
    had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug only
    that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life. Oppressed by the recollection of my
    various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did not afford me
    respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was
    possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the fiend's grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and
    cries rang in my ears. My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves
    were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was
    established between the present hour and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm
    forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible.</p>

    <p>The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and
    that I must repose before I could continue my journey. My father's care and attentions were indefatigable, but he
    did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to
    seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings,
    and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial
    mechanism. But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy
    it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the
    world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!</p>

    <p>My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair.
    Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he
    endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.</p>

    <p>"Alas! My father," said I, "how little do you know me. Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be
    degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the
    same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this&mdash;I murdered her. William, Justine, and
    Henry&mdash;they all died by my hands."</p>

    <p>My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he
    sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium,
    and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which
    I preserved in my convalescence.</p>

    <p>I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion
    that I should be supposed mad, and this in itself would forever have chained my tongue. But, besides, I could not
    bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror
    the inmates of his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I would have
    given the world to have confided the fatal secret. Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst
    uncontrollably from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my
    mysterious woe. Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, "My dearest Victor, what
    infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again."</p>

    <p>"I am not mad," I cried energetically; "the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness
    of my truth. I am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would
    I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not
    sacrifice the whole human race."</p>

    <p>The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he instantly changed the
    subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as possible to
    obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to
    speak of my misfortunes.</p>

    <p>As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same
    incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost self-violence I
    curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my
    manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice. A few days before
    we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the following letter from Elizabeth:</p>
