    <p>"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva.
    The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young
    Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your
    favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva.
    But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty
    Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a
    favourite with everybody.</p>

    <p>"I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude. Write,
    dearest Victor,&mdash;one line&mdash;one word will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his
    kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of your self;
    and, I entreat you, write!</p>

    <p class="noindent">"Elizabeth Lavenza.</p>

    <p class="noindent">"Geneva, March 18, 17&mdash;."</p>

    <p>"Dear, dear Elizabeth!" I exclaimed, when I had read her letter: "I will write instantly and relieve them from
    the anxiety they must feel." I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and
    proceeded regularly. In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.</p>

    <p>One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university. In
    doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since the
    fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to
    the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument
    would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view. He
    had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been
    my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted
    torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon
    perceived that I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and
    changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me
    out. What could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in
    my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under
    his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning
    the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took
    a more general turn. I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he was surprised,
    but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence
    that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my
    recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.</p>

    <p>M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his
    harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. "D&mdash;n the fellow!"
    cried he; "why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless
    true. A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set
    himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of
    countenance.&mdash;Ay, ay," continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, "M. Frankenstein is modest; an
    excellent quality in a young man. Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself
    when young; but that wears out in a very short time."</p>

    <p>M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was
    so annoying to me.</p>

    <p>Clerval had never sympathized in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from
    those which had occupied me. He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the
    oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to
    pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise.
    The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same
    studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former
    studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but
    consolation in the works of the orientalists. I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects,
    for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read merely to understand their
    meaning, and they well repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never
    experienced in studying the authors of any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a
    warm sun and a garden of roses,&mdash;in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own
    heart. How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!</p>

    <p>Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but
    being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was
    retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my
    beloved friends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place,
    before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although
    the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.</p>

    <p>The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my
    departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell
    to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and
    Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my
    native country.</p>
