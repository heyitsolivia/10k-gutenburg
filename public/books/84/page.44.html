    <p>On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I
    hired. It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. The thatch
    had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some
    furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the
    senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested,
    hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest
    sensations of men.</p>

    <p>In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the
    stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a monotonous yet
    ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its
    hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue
    and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to
    the roarings of the giant ocean.</p>

    <p>In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became
    every day more horrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for
    several days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy
    process in which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the
    horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the
    horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my
    hands.</p>

    <p>Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an
    instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless
    and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing
    to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the
    sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.</p>

    <p>In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced. I looked towards its completion
    with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure
    forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 20</h2>
    <p>I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; I had not
    sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my
    labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I sat, a train of reflection
    occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was engaged in
    the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it forever
    with the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she
    might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and
    wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she,
    who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made
    before her creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and
    might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might
    turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by
    the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species. Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the
    deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirsted would be
    children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species
    of man a condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon
    everlasting generations? I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck
    senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I
    shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own
    peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.</p>

    <p>I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by the light of the moon the daemon at the
    casement. A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted
    to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in
    wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise.</p>

    <p>As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery. I thought with a
    sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the
    thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for
    happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.</p>

    <p>I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then,
    with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve
    me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.</p>

    <p>Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds
    were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water,
    and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the
    silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the
    paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house.</p>
