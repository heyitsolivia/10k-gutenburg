    <p>"On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but
    the panes had been filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the
    eye could just penetrate. Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of
    furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate
    attitude. The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer,
    which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to
    produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor
    wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager
    won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air which I
    perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed
    audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised her
    and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were
    a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food;
    and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions.</p>

    <p>"Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood. The girl met him at the door,
    helped to relieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she
    and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She
    seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the
    fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in
    digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they
    entered the cottage together.</p>

    <p>"The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more
    cheerful air, and they sat down to eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again occupied in
    arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the
    youth. Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures. One was old, with silver
    hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and
    his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and
    despondency. The old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the
    morning, directed his steps across the fields.</p>

    <p>"Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by
    the use of tapers, and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I
    experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in
    various occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the
    divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to
    utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man's instrument nor the songs of
    the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or
    letters.</p>

    <p>"The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as I
    conjectured, to rest."</p>

    <p>"I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was
    the gentle manners of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well the treatment I
    had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might
    hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and
    endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.</p>

    <p>"The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food,
    and the youth departed after the first meal.</p>

    <p>"This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young man was constantly employed out of
    doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind,
    employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which
    the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They performed towards him every little office of
    affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.</p>

    <p>"They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no
    cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less
    strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They
    possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill
    and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one
    another's company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply?
    Did they really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time
    explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.</p>

    <p>"A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family: it
    was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of the
    vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could
    scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially
    the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for
    themselves.</p>
