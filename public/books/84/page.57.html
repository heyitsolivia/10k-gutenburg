    <p>But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful
    portion of food, and after an hour's rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me,
    I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for
    a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when,
    after nearly two days' journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.</p>

    <p>But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace
    of him more utterly than I had ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters
    rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind
    arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and
    overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy,
    and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a
    hideous death. In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink
    under the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour
    and life. I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight. I quickly
    destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice
    raft in the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the
    mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue
    my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon
    have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.</p>

    <p>Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the daemon, allow me the rest I so much desire; or must I
    die, and he yet live? If I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my
    vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have
    undergone? No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should
    conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live&mdash;swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and
    survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over
    my heart; but trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and fiend-like malice. Hear him
    not; call on the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust
    your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the steel aright.</p>

    <p class="noindent">Walton, in continuation.August 26th, 17&mdash;</p>

    <p>You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like
    that which even now curdles mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others,
    his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes
    were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness.
    Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice,
    suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an
    expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.</p>

    <p>His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of
    Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater
    conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected. Such a monster has,
    then, really existence! I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I endeavoured to gain
    from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature's formation, but on this point he was impenetrable. "Are you mad,
    my friend?" said he. "Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the
    world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own." Frankenstein
    discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented
    them in many places, but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy.
    "Since you have preserved my narration," said he, "I would not that a mutilated one should go down to
    posterity."</p>

    <p>Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed. My
    thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own
    elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so
    destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes
    his shattered spirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium; he
    believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his
    miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but the beings themselves
    who visit him from the regions of a remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to
    me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.</p>

    <p>Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes. On every point of general
    literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His eloquence is forcible and
    touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or
    love, without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble
    and godlike in ruin! He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.</p>
