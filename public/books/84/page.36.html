    <p>"Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which
    you had so wantonly bestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage
    and revenge. I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their
    shrieks and misery.</p>

    <p>"When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of
    discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils,
    destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a
    miserable night I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me; now and
    then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest or in
    enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and finding myself unsympathized with, wished to tear up
    the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.</p>

    <p>"But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and
    sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men that existed who
    would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting
    war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable
    misery.</p>

    <p>"The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day.
    Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my
    situation.</p>

    <p>"The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity; and when I considered
    what had passed at the cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions. I had
    certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was
    a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I ought to have familiarized the old De Lacey to
    me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared for my
    approach. But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to
    the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my party.</p>

    <p>"These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not
    allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was forever acting before my
    eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father's feet. I awoke exhausted, and
    finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in search of food.</p>

    <p>"When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All
    there was at peace. I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family
    arose. That hour passed, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I trembled
    violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I
    cannot describe the agony of this suspense.</p>

    <p>"Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they entered into conversation, using violent
    gesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed
    from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that
    he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of
    these unusual appearances.</p>

    <p>"'Do you consider,' said his companion to him, 'that you will be obliged to pay three months' rent and to lose
    the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some
    days to consider of your determination.'</p>

    <p>"'It is utterly useless,' replied Felix; 'we can never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in
    the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my sister will never
    recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me
    fly from this place.'</p>

    <p>"Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion entered the cottage, in which they remained for a
    few minutes, and then departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.</p>

    <p>"I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair. My protectors had
    departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world. For the first time the feelings of revenge and
    hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I
    bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes
    of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me.
    But again when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to
    injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As night advanced I placed a variety of
    combustibles around the cottage, and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited
    with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.</p>

    <p>"As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in
    the heavens; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst
    all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted
    cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched. A part of its orb
    was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes,
    which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to
    it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.</p>

    <p>"As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation, I quitted the scene and
    sought for refuge in the woods.</p>
