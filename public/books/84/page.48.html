    <p>The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in strong
    convulsions. A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings, as I afterwards
    heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my
    attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of
    the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke my native
    language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other
    witnesses. Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and
    rest? Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and
    youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of
    the tomb! Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the
    wheel, continually renewed the torture?</p>

    <p>But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison, stretched on a
    wretched bed, surrounded by jailers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon. It was morning,
    I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt
    as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the
    squalidness of the room in which I was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.</p>

    <p>This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one
    of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterize that class. The
    lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathizing in sights of
    misery. Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that
    I had heard during my sufferings. "Are you better now, sir?" said she.</p>

    <p>I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, "I believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not
    dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror."</p>

    <p>"For that matter," replied the old woman, "if you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were
    better for you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that's none of my business; I am
    sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the
    same."</p>

    <p>I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved, on the very
    edge of death; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series of my life appeared
    to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the
    force of reality.</p>

    <p>As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one
    was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The physician came and
    prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and
    the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second. Who could be interested in the fate of
    a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?</p>

    <p>These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness. He had caused
    the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a
    physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the
    sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a
    murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long
    intervals. One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid
    like those in death. I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to
    remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I considered whether I should not declare
    myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my thoughts
    when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered. His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion;
    he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French, "I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do
    anything to make you more comfortable?"</p>

    <p>"I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am
    capable of receiving."</p>

    <p>"I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a
    misfortune. But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to
    free you from the criminal charge."</p>

    <p>"That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted
    and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that have lately occurred. You
    were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and
    charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so
    unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path."</p>

    <p>As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt
    considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some astonishment was exhibited
    in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say, "Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were
    on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your
    relations an account of your misfortune and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I
    discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed
    since the departure of my letter. But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any
    kind."</p>
