    <p>This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief
    and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations.
    Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.</p>

    <p>About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of
    the gates regularly at ten o'clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our
    residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had
    retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was
    carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own
    course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the
    only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly&mdash;if I except some bat, or the
    frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore&mdash;often, I say, I was
    tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities forever. But I was
    restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was
    bound up in mine. I thought also of my father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them
    exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?</p>

    <p>At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them
    consolation and happiness. But that could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of
    unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new
    wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime, which
    by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past. There was always scope for fear so long as
    anything I loved remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of him I gnashed
    my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly
    bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation. I would
    have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I when there have precipitated him to their base. I
    wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of
    William and Justine. Our house was the house of mourning. My father's health was deeply shaken by the horror of the
    recent events. Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all
    pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she
    should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth
    wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects. The first of those
    sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest
    smiles.</p>

    <p>"When I reflect, my dear cousin," said she, "on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world
    and its works as they before appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in
    books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar
    to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each
    other's blood. Yet I am certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have
    committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For
    the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from
    its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human being, but
    certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know,
    I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so
    like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a
    precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine
    were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected. But even if I
    were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch."</p>

    <p>I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer.
    Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, "My dearest friend, you must calm
    yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an
    expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble. Dear Victor, banish
    these dark passions. Remember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost the power of
    rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your
    native country, we may reap every tranquil blessing&mdash;what can disturb our peace?"</p>

    <p>And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away
    the fiend that lurked in my heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very moment
    the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.</p>

    <p>Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the
    very accents of love were ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate.
    The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced
    it, and to die, was but a type of me.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my
    soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. It was
    during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys,
    sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows.
    My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my boyhood. Six
    years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.</p>
