    <p>I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and
    least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of
    August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The weight
    upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and
    precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the
    waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence&mdash;and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less
    almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as
    I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on the
    precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the
    trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white
    and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of
    beings.</p>

    <p>I passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before me, and I began to
    ascend the mountain that overhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful
    and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The high and
    snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers
    approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage. Mont
    Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous dome
    overlooked the valley.</p>

    <p>A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey. Some turn in the road, some new
    object suddenly perceived and recognized, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the lighthearted
    gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then
    again the kindly influence ceased to act&mdash;I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the
    misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,
    myself&mdash;or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and
    despair.</p>

    <p>At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of
    mind which I had endured. For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that
    played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same
    lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over
    me; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion.</p>

    <p>I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take
    their rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley.
    The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines
    were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only
    by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking,
    reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was
    ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes
    afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of
    feeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillized it. In some degree, also, they
    diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month. I retired to rest at night; my
    slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during
    the day. They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and
    ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds&mdash;they all gathered round me and bade me be at
    peace.</p>

    <p>Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy
    clouded every thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I
    even saw not the faces of those mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their
    cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the
    summit of Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced
    upon my mind when I first saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and
    allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy. The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed
    always the effect of solemnizing my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I determined to go
    without a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary
    grandeur of the scene.</p>

    <p>The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to surmount
    the perpendicularity of the mountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the
    winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others
    bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees. The path, as you ascend
    higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is
    particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air
    sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are
    sombre and add an air of severity to the scene. I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the
    rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in
    the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the
    objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only
    renders them more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly
    free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.</p>
