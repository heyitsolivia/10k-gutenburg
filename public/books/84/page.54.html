    <p>There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain
    fell in torrents. However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men to row
    and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise. But the
    overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion. I
    threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I
    saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day before in the
    company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a
    moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by
    Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds
    might lower, but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had snatched from me every hope
    of future happiness; no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history
    of man. But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale
    of horrors; I have reached their acme, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know that, one by one,
    my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words,
    what remains of my hideous narration. I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under
    the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had
    lost their charm and their delight&mdash;his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that
    affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that
    remain. Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness!
    He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he
    was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.</p>

    <p>What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed
    upon me. Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my
    youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of
    my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months,
    as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.</p>

    <p>Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to
    revenge. As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause&mdash;the monster whom
    I had created, the miserable daemon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a
    maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak
    a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.</p>

    <p>Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and
    for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had
    an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole authority
    for the apprehension of the murderer. The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness.</p>

    <p>"Be assured, sir," said he, "no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain."</p>

    <p>"I thank you," replied I; "listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so
    strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however wonderful,
    forces conviction. The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood." My
    manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my
    destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related my
    history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective
    or exclamation.</p>

    <p>The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and
    interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was
    painted on his countenance. When I had concluded my narration I said, "This is the being whom I accuse and for whose
    seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and
    hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion." This
    address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind
    of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially
    in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned. He, however, answered mildly, "I would willingly afford
    you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my
    exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where
    no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one
    can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit."</p>

    <p>"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he
    may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not credit my
    narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert." As I spoke, rage sparkled
    in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated. "You are mistaken," said he. "I will exert myself, and if it is in my
    power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from
    what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every
    proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment."</p>

    <p>"That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I
    allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is unspeakable when I
    reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have
    but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction."</p>
