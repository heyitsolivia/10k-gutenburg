    <p>We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained
    additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation
    of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial;
    but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the
    cheerful faces of children. Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until
    it was on a level with your own. A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection
    warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no
    sorrow or care. When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations. A
    serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring
    bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the
    preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden.</p>

    <p>Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he
    expressed the sensations that filled his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing:
    his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he
    invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into
    arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity. We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants
    were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with
    feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 7</h2>
    <p>On my return, I found the following letter from my father:&mdash;</p>

    <p class="noindent">"My dear Victor,</p>

    <p>"You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first
    tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But that would be a cruel
    kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to
    behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have
    rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son? I wish to prepare
    you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which
    are to convey to you the horrible tidings.</p>

    <p>"William is dead!&mdash;that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so
    gay! Victor, he is murdered!</p>

    <p>"I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction.</p>

    <p>"Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm
    and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and
    then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a
    seat until they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had
    been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards
    waited for a long time, but that he did not return.</p>

    <p>"This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured
    that he might have returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest,
    when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth
    also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had
    seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murder's finger
    was on his neck.</p>

    <p>"He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She
    was very earnest to see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room
    where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, 'O God! I have murdered my
    darling child!'</p>

    <p>"She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She
    told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed
    of your mother. This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We have
    no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my
    beloved William!</p>

    <p>"Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as
    the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for
    you, my son, to return and be our comforter? Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live
    to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!</p>

    <p>"Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and
    gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my friend,
    but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.</p>

    <p class="noindent">"Your affectionate and afflicted father, "Alphonse Frankenstein."Geneva,
    May 12th, 17&mdash;."</p>

    <p>Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe the despair that
    succeeded the joy I at first expressed on receiving new from my friends. I threw the letter on the table, and
    covered my face with my hands.</p>

    <p>"My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness, "are you always to be
    unhappy? My dear friend, what has happened?"</p>

    <p>I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation. Tears also
    gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.</p>

    <p>"I can offer you no consolation, my friend," said he; "your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to
    do?"</p>
