    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 3</h2>
    <p>When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I should become a student at the university of
    Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of
    my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My departure was
    therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life
    occurred&mdash;an omen, as it were, of my future misery. Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was
    severe, and she was in the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother
    to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of
    her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She attended her sickbed; her watchful
    attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper&mdash;Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this
    imprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most
    alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her deathbed the
    fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. "My
    children," she said, "my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union. This
    expectation will now be the consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger
    children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you
    all? But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge
    a hope of meeting you in another world."</p>

    <p>She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death. I need not describe the feelings of those
    whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the
    despair that is exhibited on the countenance. It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw
    every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed forever&mdash;that the brightness of
    a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed,
    never more to be heard. These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality
    of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear
    connection? And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? The time at length arrives when
    grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a
    sacrilege, is not banished. My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue
    our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not
    seized.</p>

    <p>My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon. I obtained
    from my father a respite of some weeks. It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of
    the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life. I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. I
    was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in
    some degree consoled.</p>

    <p>She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all. She looked steadily on life and assumed
    its duties with courage and zeal. She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and
    cousins. Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them
    upon us. She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.</p>

    <p>The day of my departure at length arrived. Clerval spent the last evening with us. He had endeavoured to persuade
    his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. His father was a
    narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son. Henry deeply felt the
    misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education. He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye
    and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of
    commerce.</p>

    <p>We sat late. We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word "Farewell!"
    It was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but
    when at morning's dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there&mdash;my father
    again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often
    and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.</p>

    <p>I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections. I, who
    had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual
    pleasure&mdash;I was now alone. In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own
    protector. My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance
    to new countenances. I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were "old familiar faces," but I believed
    myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers. Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I
    proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. I had often, when at home,
    thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my
    station among other human beings. Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to
    repent.</p>

    <p>I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and
    fatiguing. At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes. I alighted and was conducted to my solitary
    apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.</p>

    <p>The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors.
    Chance&mdash;or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the
    moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's door&mdash;led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural
    philosophy. He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He asked me several questions
    concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy. I replied
    carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied. The
    professor stared. "Have you," he said, "really spent your time in studying such nonsense?"</p>
