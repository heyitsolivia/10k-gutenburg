    <p>"I am happy," said M. Waldman, "to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no
    doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been
    and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not
    neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department
    of human knowledge alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist,
    I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics." He then took me into his
    laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and
    promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their
    mechanism. He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave.</p>

    <p>Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 4</h2>
    <p>From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became
    nearly my sole occupation. I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern
    inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of
    science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined,
    it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I
    found a true friend. His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of
    frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of
    knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at first
    fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars
    often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.</p>

    <p>As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid. My ardour was indeed the
    astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the masters. Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly
    smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two
    years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit
    of some discoveries which I hoped to make. None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements
    of science. In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in
    a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder. A mind of moderate capacity which closely
    pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the
    attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two
    years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem and
    admiration at the university. When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and
    practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there
    being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an
    incident happened that protracted my stay.</p>

    <p>One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame, and,
    indeed, any animal endued with life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It was a bold
    question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of
    becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in
    my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which
    relate to physiology. Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study
    would have been irksome and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death.
    I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay
    and corruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should
    be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to
    have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the
    receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the
    worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults
    and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human
    feelings. I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the
    blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and
    analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until
    from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me&mdash;a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so
    simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that
    among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be
    reserved to discover so astonishing a secret.</p>

    <p>Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman. The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than
    that which I now affirm is true. Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct
    and probable. After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of
    generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.</p>

    <p>The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture. After
    so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying
    consummation of my toils. But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been
    progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result. What had been the study and desire of the
    wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp. Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon
    me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point
    them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished. I was like the Arabian who
    had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual
    light.</p>
