    <p>"When younger," said he, "I believed myself destined for some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I
    possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of the worth of my
    nature supported me when others would have been oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief
    those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a
    one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common
    projectors. But this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me
    lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence,
    I am chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense;
    by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect
    without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers,
    now burning with the idea of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but
    how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognize me in this state of
    degradation. Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never
    again to rise." Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who would
    sympathize with and love me. Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only
    to know his value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.</p>

    <p>"I thank you, Walton," he said, "for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of
    new ties and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any man be to me as Clerval
    was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,
    the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can
    obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated;
    and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a
    brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing,
    when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion.
    But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am,
    the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead,
    and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high
    undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But
    such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will be
    fulfilled and I may die."</p>

    <p class="noindent">September 2ndMy beloved Sister,</p>

    <p>I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear England and the
    dearer friends that inhabit it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every
    moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but
    I have none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not
    desert me. Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me. If we are lost,
    my mad schemes are the cause.</p>

    <p>And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously
    await my return. Years will pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My beloved
    sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own
    death.</p>

    <p>But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!</p>

    <p>My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if
    life were a possession which he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators
    who have attempted this sea, and in spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel the
    power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and while they hear his
    voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the resolutions of man. These
    feelings are transitory; each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by
    this despair.</p>

    <p class="noindent">September 5th</p>

    <p>A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is highly probable that these papers may
    never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it.</p>

    <p>We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict. The
    cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation.
    Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when
    suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.</p>

    <p>I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny. This morning, as I sat watching the wan
    countenance of my friend&mdash;his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly&mdash;I was roused by half a
    dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They entered, and their leader addressed me. He told me
    that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition
    which, in justice, I could not refuse. We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they feared that
    if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my
    voyage and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted this. They insisted, therefore,
    that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course
    southwards.</p>

    <p>This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free. Yet
    could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when Frankenstein,
    who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his
    eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men, he said, "What do you mean?
    What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then, so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a
    glorious expedition?</p>
