    <p>"Why do you call to my remembrance," I rejoined, "circumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that I have been
    the miserable origin and author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light! Cursed (although I
    curse myself) be the hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power
    to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from the sight of your detested form."</p>

    <p>"Thus I relieve thee, my creator," he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me with
    violence; "thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion.
    By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the
    temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet
    high in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world,
    you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit forever the neighbourhood of man and
    lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin."</p>

    <p>As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart was full, and I did not answer him, but as I
    proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale. I was
    partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of
    my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also, I felt what the
    duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his
    wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the
    opposite rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of
    exultation, I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire
    which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 11</h2>
    <p>"It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being; all the events of that period
    appear confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at
    the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various
    senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes.
    Darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose,
    the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in
    my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found
    that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became
    more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade.
    This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt
    tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found
    hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by
    sleep.</p>

    <p>"It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so
    desolate. Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but
    these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and
    could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.</p>

    <p>"Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure. I started up and beheld a
    radiant form rise from among the trees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it
    enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries. I was still cold when under one of the trees I found
    a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was
    confused. I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides
    various scents saluted me; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that
    with pleasure.</p>

    <p>"Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish
    my sensations from each other. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees
    that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often
    saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my
    eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of
    the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was
    unable. Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which
    broke from me frightened me into silence again.</p>

    <p>"The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained
    in the forest. My sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas. My
    eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from
    the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those
    of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.</p>

    <p>"One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was
    overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but
    quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such
    opposite effects! I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. I quickly
    collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the
    operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected
    on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great
    quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with
    it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves
    and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep.</p>
