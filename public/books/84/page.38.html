    <p>"Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me. As soon as he beheld my form,
    he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said,
    'Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.'</p>

    <p>"He struggled violently. 'Let me go,' he cried; 'monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces.
    You are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.'</p>

    <p>"'Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.'</p>

    <p>"'Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic&mdash;he is M. Frankenstein&mdash;he will punish you. You dare
    not keep me.'</p>

    <p>"'Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy&mdash;to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be
    my first victim.'</p>

    <p>"The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to
    silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.</p>

    <p>"I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed,
    'I too can create desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand
    other miseries shall torment and destroy him.'</p>

    <p>"As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a
    most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I gazed with delight on
    her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was
    forever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance I
    contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and
    affright.</p>

    <p>"Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only wonder that at that moment, instead of
    venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy
    them.</p>

    <p>"While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more
    secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was sleeping on some straw;
    she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the
    loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but
    me. And then I bent over her and whispered, 'Awake, fairest, thy lover is near&mdash;he who would give his life but
    to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!'</p>

    <p>"The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and
    denounce the murderer? Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me. The thought was
    madness; it stirred the fiend within me&mdash;not I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am
    forever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had its source in her; be hers the
    punishment! Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief. I
    bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.</p>

    <p>"For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes
    resolved to quit the world and its miseries forever. At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged
    through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you
    have promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as
    deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species and have the
    same defects. This being you must create."</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 17</h2>
    <p>The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered,
    perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He
    continued,</p>

    <p>"You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my
    being. This you alone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede."</p>

    <p>The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful
    life among the cottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me.</p>

    <p>"I do refuse it," I replied; "and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. You may render me the most
    miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint
    wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never
    consent."</p>

    <p>"You are in the wrong," replied the fiend; "and instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am
    malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to
    pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it
    murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands.
    Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury
    I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human
    senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will
    revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my
    creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I
    desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth."</p>

    <p>A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes
    to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that YOU are the cause of its
    excess. If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for
    that one creature's sake I would make peace with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be
    realized. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as
    myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall
    be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives
    will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me happy; let
    me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not
    deny me my request!"</p>
