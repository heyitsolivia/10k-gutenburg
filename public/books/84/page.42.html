    <p class="poem">&mdash;&mdash;The sounding cataractHaunted him like a passion: the tall rock,The mountain, and the
    deep and gloomy wood,Their colours and their forms, were then to himAn appetite; a feeling, and a love,That had no
    need of a remoter charm,By thought supplied, or any interestUnborrow'd from the eye.[Wordsworth's "Tintern
    Abbey".]</p>

    <p>And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas,
    imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its
    creator;&mdash;has this mind perished? Does it now only exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so
    divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy
    friend.</p>

    <p>Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry,
    but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will proceed with my
    tale.</p>

    <p>Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way, for the
    wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us. Our journey here lost the interest arising
    from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England. It was on
    a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the
    Thames presented a new scene; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of
    some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich&mdash;places
    which I had heard of even in my country.</p>

    <p>At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul's towering above all, and the Tower famed in English
    history.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 19</h2>
    <p>London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated
    city. Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time, but this was with
    me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the
    completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me,
    addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers.</p>

    <p>If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible
    pleasure. But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information
    they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when
    alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus
    cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw
    an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and
    Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.</p>

    <p>But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and
    instruction. The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and
    amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that
    he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of
    materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the execution
    of his plan. He was forever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried
    to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering
    on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him, alleging
    another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new
    creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head. Every
    thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips
    to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.</p>

    <p>After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our
    visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient
    allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to
    accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the
    wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places. We had arrived in England at the beginning of
    October, and it was now February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the
    expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to
    visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about
    the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my
    labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.</p>

    <p>We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This
    was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all
    novelties to us.</p>

    <p>From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the
    events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles I. had
    collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join
    the standard of Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable
    Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they
    might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its
    footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself
    sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
    magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a
    placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among
    aged trees.</p>
