    <p>As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded towards the spot. They
    seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures
    that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they
    spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. "My good friends," said I, "will you be so kind as
    to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am?"</p>

    <p>"You will know that soon enough," replied a man with a hoarse voice. "Maybe you are come to a place that will not
    prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you."</p>

    <p>I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on
    perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions. "Why do you answer me so roughly?" I replied.
    "Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably."</p>

    <p>"I do not know," said the man, "what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate
    villains." While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase. Their faces expressed a
    mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me.</p>

    <p>I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the
    crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said,
    "Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin's to give an account of yourself."</p>

    <p>"Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not this a free country?"</p>

    <p>"Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death
    of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night."</p>

    <p>This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent; that could easily be proved;
    accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to
    sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that
    no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity
    that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death. I must
    pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to
    relate, in proper detail, to my recollection.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 21</h2>
    <p>I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He
    looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who
    appeared as witnesses on this occasion.</p>

    <p>About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out
    fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o'clock, they observed a
    strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not
    yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below. He
    walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance.</p>

    <p>As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground.
    His companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of
    a man, who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had
    been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and
    even that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and
    endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years
    of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on
    his neck.</p>

    <p>The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but when the mark of the fingers was
    mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist
    came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and
    of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.</p>

    <p>The son confirmed his father's account, but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before
    the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and as far as
    he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same boat in which I had just landed. A woman deposed that
    she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about
    an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from
    that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found.</p>

    <p>Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold.
    They put it into a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.</p>

    <p>Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that, with the strong north wind that had
    arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return
    nearly to the same spot from which I had departed. Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the
    body from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the
    harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of &mdash;&mdash; from the place where I had deposited the corpse.</p>

    <p>Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for
    interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably
    suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described. I was accordingly
    conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the strange
    coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with several
    persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to
    the consequences of the affair. I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How can I
    describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment
    without shuddering and agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream
    from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing
    myself on the body, I exclaimed, "Have my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I
    have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor&mdash;"</p>
