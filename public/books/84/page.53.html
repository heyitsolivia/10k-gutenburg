    <p>The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the
    higher and the glens of the lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre
    of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the
    range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.</p>

    <p>The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft
    air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it
    wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched
    the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me forever.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 23</h2>
    <p>It was eight o'clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and
    then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet
    still displaying their black outlines.</p>

    <p>The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west. The moon had reached her
    summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the
    vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the
    restless waves that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.</p>

    <p>I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my
    mind. I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound
    terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or
    that of my adversary was extinguished. Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,
    but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, "What is it that
    agitates you, my dear Victor? What is it you fear?"</p>

    <p>"Oh! Peace, peace, my love," replied I; "this night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very
    dreadful."</p>

    <p>I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily
    expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had
    obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.</p>

    <p>She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner
    that might afford a retreat to my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that
    some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and
    dreadful scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into
    my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my
    veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated,
    and I rushed into the room. Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the destruction of the
    best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head
    hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I turn I see the same
    figure&mdash;her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and
    live? Alas! Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment only did I lose recollection;
    I fell senseless on the ground.</p>

    <p>When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their countenances expressed a breathless
    terror, but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I escaped
    from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She
    had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a
    handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced
    her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased
    to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished. The murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the
    breath had ceased to issue from her lips. While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look
    up. The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of
    the moon illuminate the chamber. The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be
    described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred. A grin was on the face of the monster;
    he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards the
    window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and running with the
    swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.</p>

    <p>The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we
    followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most
    of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to
    search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines.</p>

    <p>I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house, but my head whirled round, my steps
    were like those of a drunken man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes, and my skin
    was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what
    had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that I had lost.</p>

    <p>After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay. There
    were women weeping around; I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea
    presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes
    and their cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death of William, the execution of Justine,
    the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were
    safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead
    at his feet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with
    all possible speed.</p>
