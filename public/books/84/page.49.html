    <p>"This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me what new scene of death has been
    acted, and whose murder I am now to lament?"</p>

    <p>"Your family is perfectly well," said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; "and someone, a friend, is come to visit
    you."</p>

    <p>I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the
    murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply
    with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony, "Oh! Take him away! I cannot see
    him; for God's sake, do not let him enter!"</p>

    <p>Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption
    of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone, "I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father
    would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance."</p>

    <p>"My father!" cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure. "Is my father
    indeed come? How kind, how very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?"</p>

    <p>My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a
    momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and quitted the room with
    my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.</p>

    <p>Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father. I stretched out my
    hand to him and cried, "Are you, then, safe&mdash;and Elizabeth&mdash;and Ernest?" My father calmed me with
    assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my
    desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness.</p>

    <p>"What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!" said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched
    appearance of the room. "You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you. And poor
    Clerval&mdash;"</p>

    <p>The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; I shed
    tears. "Alas! Yes, my father," replied I; "some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to
    fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry."</p>

    <p>We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my health rendered every
    precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be
    exhausted by too much exertion. But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I
    gradually recovered my health.</p>

    <p>As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The
    image of Clerval was forever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation into which these
    reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and
    detested a life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon,
    will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust;
    and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant,
    although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for
    some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.</p>

    <p>The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months in prison, and although I was still weak
    and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the
    court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was
    spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides
    on life and death. The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the
    hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.</p>

    <p>My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge, that I was again allowed to
    breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not participate in these feelings,
    for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned forever, and although
    the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful
    darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes they were the expressive
    eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed
    them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at
    Ingolstadt.</p>

    <p>My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of
    Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness
    and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring maladie du pays, to see once
    more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood; but my general state of feeling
    was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and these fits were
    seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to
    the existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some
    dreadful act of violence.</p>
