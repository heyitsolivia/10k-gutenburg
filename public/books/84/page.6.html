    <p>There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them
    only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There was a sense of justice in my father's upright mind which rendered
    it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the
    late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a
    show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for
    it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for
    the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Everything was made to
    yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener,
    from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and
    benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she
    had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually
    relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy,
    and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her
    weakened frame.</p>

    <p>From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant
    accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each
    other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My
    mother's tender caresses and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections.
    I was their plaything and their idol, and something better&mdash;their child, the innocent and helpless creature
    bestowed on them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to
    happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they
    owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it
    may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of
    self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me. For a long time I
    was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I
    was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores
    of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my
    mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion&mdash;remembering what she had suffered, and how she had
    been relieved&mdash;for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor
    cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of
    half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day, when my father had gone by
    himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working,
    bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which
    attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were dark-eyed, hardy
    little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty
    of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes
    cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could
    behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in
    all her features. The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely
    girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother
    was a German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse: they were
    better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their
    charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy&mdash;one among the schiavi
    ognor frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its weakness.
    Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known. His property was confiscated; his
    child became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer
    than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles. When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the
    hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub&mdash;a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks
    and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his
    permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet
    orphan. Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want
    when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was that
    Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents' house&mdash;my more than sister&mdash;the beautiful and adored
    companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.</p>

    <p>Everyone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became,
    while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had
    said playfully, "I have a pretty present for my Victor&mdash;tomorrow he shall have it." And when, on the morrow,
    she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally
    and looked upon Elizabeth as mine&mdash;mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on her I received
    as made to a possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression
    could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me&mdash;my more than sister, since till death she was
    to be mine only.</p>
