    <p>We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages. I need not say that we were
    strangers to any species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and
    contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated
    disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with
    the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic
    and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home &mdash;the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the
    seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine summers&mdash;she found
    ample scope for admiration and delight. While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the
    magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a secret which I
    desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they
    were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.</p>

    <p>On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and
    fixed themselves in their native country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive, the eastern
    shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city. We resided principally in the latter,
    and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach
    myself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the
    bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy
    of singular talent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake. He was deeply read in
    books of chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly
    adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the
    heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem
    the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels.</p>

    <p>No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of
    kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the
    agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly
    discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.</p>

    <p>My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned not
    towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess
    that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed
    attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward
    substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my
    inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things. The busy stage of life, the
    virtues of heroes, and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those
    whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul of
    Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice,
    the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living spirit of love
    to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in my study, rought through the ardour of my nature, but that she
    was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And Clerval&mdash;could aught ill entrench on the noble
    spirit of Clerval? Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of
    kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness
    of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition.</p>

    <p>I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind
    and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides, in
    drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of
    misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it
    arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became
    the torrent which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys. Natural philosophy is the genius that has
    regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for
    that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the
    inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to find a volume
    of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the
    wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind,
    and bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my
    book and said, "Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash."</p>
