    <p>I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of
    the future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, and if I
    was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime
    in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a
    blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease
    to be&mdash;a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.</p>

    <p>We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot
    which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often
    prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and
    the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to
    contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the
    remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but
    the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.</p>

    <p>We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest. The country in the
    neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a
    lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of
    my native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities
    are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name made me tremble when
    pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.</p>

    <p>From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost
    fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the
    mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we
    made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably
    greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater
    capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his
    inferiors. "I could pass my life here," said he to me; "and among these mountains I should scarcely regret
    Switzerland and the Rhine."</p>

    <p>But he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are
    forever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he
    rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other
    novelties.</p>

    <p>We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of
    the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on.
    For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the
    daemon's disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. This idea pursued
    me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my
    letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when
    they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate.
    Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. When
    these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him
    from the fancied rage of his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which
    haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of
    crime.</p>

    <p>I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate
    being. Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him. But
    the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in
    the world, Arthur's Seat, St. Bernard's Well, and the Pentland Hills compensated him for the change and filled him
    with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.</p>

    <p>We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew's, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth,
    where our friend expected us. But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or
    plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of
    Scotland alone. "Do you," said I, "enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two;
    but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I
    return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper."</p>

    <p>Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate. He entreated me to write
    often. "I had rather be with you," he said, "in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not
    know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in
    your absence."</p>

    <p>Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude.
    I did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that
    he might receive his companion. With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the
    remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a
    rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for
    a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy
    limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh
    water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five miles distant.</p>
