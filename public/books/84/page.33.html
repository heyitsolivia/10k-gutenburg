    <p>"He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which
    deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.</p>

    <p>"They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them. Felix soon learned that the
    treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer
    was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his
    daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future
    maintenance.</p>

    <p>"Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most
    miserable of his family. He could have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he
    gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and
    irreparable. The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.</p>

    <p>"When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his
    daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous nature of Safie
    was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his
    tyrannical mandate.</p>

    <p>"A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter's apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe
    that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French
    government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a
    few hours. He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with
    the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.</p>

    <p>"When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this
    emergency. A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it. By
    some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the
    spot where he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination. Taking with her
    some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but
    who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany.</p>

    <p>"She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell
    dangerously ill. Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left
    alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell,
    however, into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound, and after her
    death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of
    her lover."</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 15</h2>
    <p>"Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply. I learned, from the views of social life
    which it developed, to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.</p>

    <p>"As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting
    within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and
    displayed. But in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred
    in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.</p>

    <p>"One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home
    firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some
    books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. Fortunately the books were written in the
    language, the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of Paradise Lost, a volume of
    Plutarch's Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter. The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now
    continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary
    occupations.</p>

    <p>"I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced in me an infinity of new images and
    feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In the Sorrows
    of Werter, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights
    thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation
    and astonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which
    had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants
    which were forever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or
    imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon death and suicide were
    calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards
    the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it.</p>

    <p>"As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition. I found myself similar yet at
    the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener. I
    sympathized with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to
    none. 'The path of my departure was free,' and there was none to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous and
    my stature gigantic. What did this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my destination? These
    questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.</p>
