    <p>I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but I felt that there was
    some justice in his argument. His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine
    sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He
    saw my change of feeling and continued,</p>

    <p>"If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of
    South America. My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and
    berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with
    the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food.
    The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness
    of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the
    favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire."</p>

    <p>"You propose," replied I, "to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the
    field will be your only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile?
    You will return and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be
    renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to argue
    the point, for I cannot consent."</p>

    <p>"How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again
    harden yourself to my complaints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that with
    the companion you bestow I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of
    places. My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly away, and in my
    dying moments I shall not curse my maker."</p>

    <p>His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I
    looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to
    those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathize with him, I
    had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.</p>

    <p>"You swear," I said, "to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably
    make me distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for
    your revenge?"</p>

    <p>"How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and
    vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of
    whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my
    virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive
    being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded."</p>

    <p>I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed. I thought of
    the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all
    kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him. His power and threats were
    not omitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers and hide himself from
    pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with.
    After a long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me
    that I should comply with his request. Turning to him, therefore, I said,</p>

    <p>"I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe forever, and every other place in the neighbourhood
    of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile."</p>

    <p>"I swear," he cried, "by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart,
    that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your home and commence your
    labours; I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall
    appear."</p>

    <p>Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments. I saw him descend the
    mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of
    ice.</p>

    <p>His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed. I knew that
    I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was
    heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as
    I advanced perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced. Night was
    far advanced when I came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone at
    intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree
    lay on the ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly,
    and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, "Oh! Stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye
    really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in
    darkness."</p>

    <p>These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars
    weighed upon me and how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume
    me.</p>

    <p>Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva.
    Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensations&mdash;they weighed on me with a mountain's weight
    and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them. Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to
    the family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I
    felt as if I were placed under a ban&mdash;as if I had no right to claim their sympathies&mdash;as if never more
    might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to
    dedicate myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of
    existence pass before me like a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality of life.</p>
