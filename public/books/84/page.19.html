    <p>No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the
    open air. But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and
    despair. I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect
    purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let
    loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.</p>

    <p>Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were open, and I hastened to my father's house.
    My first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused
    when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me
    at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had
    been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise
    so utterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked
    upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I
    were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who could
    arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Saleve? These reflections determined me, and I
    resolved to remain silent.</p>

    <p>It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's house. I told the servants not to disturb the family,
    and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising.</p>

    <p>Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had
    last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained to me. I
    gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my
    father's desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead
    father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted
    the sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.
    While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me: "Welcome, my dearest
    Victor," said he. "Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and
    delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive
    our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her
    vain and tormenting self-accusations.&mdash;Poor William! he was our darling and our pride!"</p>

    <p>Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother's eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only
    imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster.
    I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.</p>

    <p>"She most of all," said Ernest, "requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my
    brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt to pursue him? It is impossible; one might
    as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last
    night!"</p>

    <p>"I do not know what you mean," replied my brother, in accents of wonder, "but to us the discovery we have made
    completes our misery. No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced,
    notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all
    the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?"</p>

    <p>"Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes
    it, surely, Ernest?"</p>

    <p>"No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own
    behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt.
    But she will be tried today, and you will then hear all."</p>

    <p>He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken
    ill, and confined to her bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the
    apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had
    been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without
    saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended. On
    being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of
    manner.</p>

    <p>This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, "You are all mistaken; I know
    the murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent."</p>

    <p>At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to
    welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic
    than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, "Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer
    of poor William."</p>

    <p>"We do also, unfortunately," replied my father, "for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have
    discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly."</p>

    <p>"My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent."</p>

    <p>"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope,
    that she will be acquitted."</p>

    <p>This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was
    guiltless of this murder. I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong
    enough to convict her. My tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as
    madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses
    convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon
    the world?</p>
