    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 18</h2>
    <p>Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and I could not collect the courage to
    recommence my work. I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to
    the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to
    profound study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English
    philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father's
    consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first
    step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me. A change indeed had taken
    place in me; my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the
    memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his
    thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return
    by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the
    most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to
    the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some
    degree of composure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful
    heart.</p>

    <p>It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me,</p>

    <p>"I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to
    yourself. And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to
    the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on
    such a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all."</p>

    <p>I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued&mdash;"I confess, my son, that I have always looked
    forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining
    years. You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in
    dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived
    to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister,
    without any wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and
    considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you
    appear to feel."</p>

    <p>"My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited,
    as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the
    expectation of our union."</p>

    <p>"The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some
    time experienced. If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us.
    But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,
    therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnization of the marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent
    events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You are younger; yet I do
    not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any
    future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate
    happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words with candour
    and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity."</p>

    <p>I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly
    in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me the idea of an
    immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet
    fulfilled and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family!
    Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground? I must
    perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a
    union from which I expected peace.</p>

    <p>I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England or entering into a long
    correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to
    me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and
    unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my
    father's house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful accidents
    might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware
    also that I should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess
    me during the progress of my unearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed. Once
    commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise
    fulfilled, the monster would depart forever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to
    destroy him and put an end to my slavery forever.</p>

    <p>These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit England, but concealing the true
    reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with
    an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that
    resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the
    idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have
    restored me entirely to myself.</p>

    <p>The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most a year, was the period
    contemplated. One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without previously
    communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasbourg. This
    interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the
    presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours
    of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone,
    would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?</p>
