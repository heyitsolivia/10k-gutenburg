    <p>Yesterday the stranger said to me, "You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and
    unparalleled misfortunes. I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you
    have won me to alter my determination. You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that
    the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not know that the
    relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing
    yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my
    tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure. Prepare to hear
    of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to
    encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious
    regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; nor can I
    doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is
    composed."</p>

    <p>You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication, yet I could not endure that he
    should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised
    narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I
    expressed these feelings in my answer.</p>

    <p>"I thank you," he replied, "for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one
    event, and then I shall repose in peace. I understand your feeling," continued he, perceiving that I wished to
    interrupt him; "but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my
    destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined."</p>

    <p>He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure. This promise drew
    from me the warmest thanks. I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to
    record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day. If I should be engaged, I will
    at least make notes. This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him, and
    who hear it from his own lips&mdash;with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as
    I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy
    sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul
    within.</p>

    <p>Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and
    wrecked it&mdash;thus!</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been
    for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and
    reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business.
    He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had
    prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a
    family.</p>

    <p>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his
    most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty.
    This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty
    and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid
    his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he
    lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his
    retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct
    so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope
    of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance. Beaufort had taken effectual measures
    to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he
    hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair
    alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was
    sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable
    employment in a merchant's house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep
    and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of
    three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.</p>

    <p>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was
    rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an
    uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and
    by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.</p>

    <p>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending
    him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan
    and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort's coffin weeping bitterly, when my father
    entered the chamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after
    the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years
    after this event Caroline became his wife.</p>
