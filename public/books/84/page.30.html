    <p>"My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures;
    I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it
    might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the
    venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me. I looked upon them as superior
    beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting
    myself to them, and their reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour
    and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love.</p>

    <p>"These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language. My
    organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I
    pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle
    ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and
    execration.</p>

    <p>"The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth. Men who before this
    change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The
    birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit
    habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by
    the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future
    gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy."</p>

    <p>"I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which,
    from what I had been, have made me what I am.</p>

    <p>"Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless. It surprised me that what before was
    desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and
    refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.</p>

    <p>"It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour&mdash;the old man played on his
    guitar, and the children listened to him&mdash;that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond
    expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he
    inquired the cause of his son's sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his
    music when someone tapped at the door.</p>

    <p>"It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide. The lady was dressed in a dark suit and
    covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a
    sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this
    word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of
    angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but
    gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek
    tinged with a lovely pink.</p>

    <p>"Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it
    instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled,
    as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared
    affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed
    it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to understand
    him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some
    conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man's feet and would
    have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.</p>

    <p>"I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her
    own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not
    comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun
    dissipates the morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha,
    the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which
    appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their
    countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence
    of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the
    idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned
    about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I
    profited by the others.</p>

    <p>"As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the
    stranger and said, 'Good night sweet Safie.' He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent
    repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently
    desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.</p>

    <p>"The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the
    Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they
    at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or
    dying away like a nightingale of the woods.</p>

    <p>"When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it. She played a simple air, and her
    voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared
    enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to
    express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.</p>
