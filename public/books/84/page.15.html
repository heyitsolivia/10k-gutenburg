    <p>"Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear
    friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love?"</p>

    <p>"If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here
    some days for you; it is from your cousin, I believe."</p>

    <p>Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my own Elizabeth:</p>

    <p class="noindent">"My dearest Cousin,</p>

    <p>"You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me
    on your account. You are forbidden to write&mdash;to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to
    calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have
    restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences
    and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself! I
    figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could
    never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin. Yet that is over now:
    Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in
    your own handwriting.</p>

    <p>"Get well&mdash;and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly. Your
    father's health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will
    ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now
    sixteen and full of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we
    cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a
    military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application. He looks upon study as an
    odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake. I fear that he will
    become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.</p>

    <p>"Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us. The blue lake and
    snow-clad mountains&mdash;they never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by
    the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions
    by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little
    household. Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not; I will relate
    her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine
    was the third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother
    could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when
    Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. The republican
    institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great
    monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the
    lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva
    does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the
    duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a
    sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.</p>

    <p>"Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in
    an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the
    beauty of Angelica&mdash;she looked so frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by
    which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended. This benefit was
    fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any
    professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
    Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every
    gesture of my aunt. She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and
    manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.</p>

    <p>"When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had
    attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were
    reserved for her.</p>

    <p>"One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left
    childless. The conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a
    judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed
    the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called
    home by her repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death
    of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for
    vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother's house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very
    vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her
    of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a
    decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach
    of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us; and I assure you I love her
    tenderly. She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression
    continually remind me of my dear aunt.</p>

    <p>"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William. I wish you could see him; he is
    very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he smiles, two little
    dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health. He has already had one or two little WIVES, but Louisa
    Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.</p>
