    <p>Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth,
    and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and
    misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend,
    therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for some time
    about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. "You may easily
    believe," said he, "how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not
    comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his
    constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield:
    'I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.' But his affection for me at length
    overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of
    knowledge."</p>

    <p>"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth."</p>

    <p>"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture
    you a little upon their account myself. But, my dear Frankenstein," continued he, stopping short and gazing full in
    my face, "I did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching
    for several nights."</p>

    <p>"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself
    sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I
    am at length free."</p>

    <p>I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to, the occurrences of the
    preceding night. I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought
    made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I
    dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him. Entreating him, therefore, to
    remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the lock
    of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly
    open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side;
    but nothing appeared. I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed from its
    hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured
    that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.</p>

    <p>We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself. It was
    not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I
    was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed
    aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more
    attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless
    laughter frightened and astonished him.</p>

    <p>"My dear Victor," cried he, "what, for God's sake, is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are!
    What is the cause of all this?"</p>

    <p>"Do not ask me," cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the
    room; "HE can tell. Oh, save me! Save me!" I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell
    down in a fit.</p>

    <p>Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely
    turned to bitterness. But I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a
    long, long time.</p>

    <p>This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months. During all that time Henry was
    my only nurse. I afterwards learned that, knowing my father's advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and
    how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder. He
    knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my
    recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards
    them.</p>

    <p>But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could
    have restored me to life. The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was forever before my eyes, and I
    raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings
    of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him
    that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.</p>

    <p>By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the
    first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen
    leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was a
    divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection
    revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the
    fatal passion.</p>

    <p>"Dearest Clerval," exclaimed I, "how kind, how very good you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent
    in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I feel the
    greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me."</p>

    <p>"You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you
    appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?"</p>

    <p>I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think? "Compose
    yourself," said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, "I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your
    father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting. They hardly know
    how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence."</p>
