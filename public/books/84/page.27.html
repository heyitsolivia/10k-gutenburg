    <p>"It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze
    quickly fanned it into a flame. I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when
    they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as
    heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the
    travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I
    tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers. I found that the berries were
    spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.</p>

    <p>"Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the
    pangs of hunger. When I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one
    where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss
    of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the
    serious consideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it, and wrapping
    myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at
    length discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of
    one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that
    covered the ground.</p>

    <p>"It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut,
    on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This was a new sight to me,
    and I examined the structure with great curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it, near a
    fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly,
    and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable. His
    appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by
    the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me
    then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandemonium appeared to the demons of hell after their sufferings in the
    lake of fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk,
    and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell
    asleep.</p>

    <p>"It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I
    determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant's breakfast in a wallet I found, I
    proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this
    appear! The huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns. The vegetables in the
    gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of
    the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one
    of the women fainted. The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones
    and many other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,
    quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village. This hovel however,
    joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter
    it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood,
    however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by
    innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.</p>

    <p>"Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of
    the season, and still more from the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might
    view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the
    back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water. One part
    was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and
    wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the
    sty, and that was sufficient for me.</p>

    <p>"Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a
    distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I had first,
    however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which
    I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. The floor was a
    little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably
    warm.</p>

    <p>"Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my
    determination. It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping
    branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a
    little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her
    head, passing before my hovel. The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers
    and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only
    garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost sight of her, and in about a
    quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,
    seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering
    a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself. She
    followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field
    behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.</p>
