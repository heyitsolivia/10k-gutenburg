    <p>"The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life. My
    attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors.
    I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should
    be alone. I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of
    horror with those who had formerly beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought,
    therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I
    might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors.</p>

    <p>"One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it
    denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was
    left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but
    sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his countenance was illuminated
    with pleasure, but as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the instrument, he
    sat absorbed in reflection.</p>

    <p>"My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide my hopes or realize my fears. The
    servants were gone to a neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent
    opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose,
    and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to
    conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their
    cottage.</p>

    <p>"I knocked. 'Who is there?' said the old man. 'Come in.'</p>

    <p>"I entered. 'Pardon this intrusion,' said I; 'I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige
    me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.'</p>

    <p>"'Enter,' said De Lacey, 'and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my
    children are from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.'</p>

    <p>"'Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is warmth and rest only that I need.'</p>

    <p>"I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what
    manner to commence the interview, when the old man addressed me. 'By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my
    countryman; are you French?'</p>

    <p>"'No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only. I am now going to claim the
    protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.'</p>

    <p>"'Are they Germans?'</p>

    <p>"'No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around
    and I have no relation or friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of
    me. I am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world forever.'</p>

    <p>"'Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any
    obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends
    are good and amiable, do not despair.'</p>

    <p>"'They are kind&mdash;they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced
    against me. I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal
    prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable
    monster.'</p>

    <p>"'That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you undeceive them?'</p>

    <p>"'I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors. I
    tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards
    them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.'</p>

    <p>"'Where do these friends reside?'</p>

    <p>"'Near this spot.'</p>

    <p>"The old man paused and then continued, 'If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I
    perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something
    in your words which persuades me that you are sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure
    to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.'</p>

    <p>"'Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I
    trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures.'</p>

    <p>"'Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate
    you to virtue. I also am unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent; judge, therefore, if I
    do not feel for your misfortunes.'</p>

    <p>"'How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness
    directed towards me; I shall be forever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends
    whom I am on the point of meeting.'</p>

    <p>"'May I know the names and residence of those friends?'</p>

    <p>"I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me forever.
    I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank
    on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment to
    lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, 'Now is the time! Save and protect me! You and your family are
    the friends whom I seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!'</p>

    <p>"'Great God!' exclaimed the old man. 'Who are you?'</p>

    <p>"At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror
    and consternation on beholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the
    cottage. Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a
    transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick. I could have torn him limb from
    limb, as the lion rends the antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw
    him on the point of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the
    general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel."</p>
