    <p>His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, "To seek one who fled from
    me."</p>

    <p>"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?"</p>

    <p>"Yes."</p>

    <p>"Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man
    in it, across the ice."</p>

    <p>This aroused the stranger's attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the
    demon, as he called him, had pursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, "I have, doubtless, excited
    your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries."</p>

    <p>"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of
    mine."</p>

    <p>"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life."</p>

    <p>Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge. I
    replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and
    the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge. From this
    time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be
    upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he
    is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere. I have promised that someone should watch for him and give
    him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.</p>

    <p>Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day. The stranger has gradually
    improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin. Yet his manners
    are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little
    communication with him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me
    with sympathy and compassion. He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so
    attractive and amiable. I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide
    ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have
    possessed as the brother of my heart.</p>

    <p>I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to
    record.</p>

    <p class="noindent">August 13th, 17&mdash;</p>

    <p>My affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing
    degree. How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief? He is so
    gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest
    art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence. He is now much recovered from his illness and is
    continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although unhappy, he is not
    so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has
    frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered attentively into
    all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure
    it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the
    burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune,
    my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man's life or death were but a small price to
    pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the
    elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener's countenance. At first I perceived
    that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I
    beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused; at length he
    spoke, in broken accents: "Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?
    Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!"</p>

    <p>Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the
    stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore
    his composure. Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of
    passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He
    asked me the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection. I
    spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever
    fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this
    blessing. "I agree with you," replied the stranger; "we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser,
    better, dearer than ourselves&mdash;such a friend ought to be&mdash;do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak
    and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge
    respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair. But I&mdash;I have
    lost everything and cannot begin life anew."</p>

    <p>As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that touched me to the heart. But he
    was silent and presently retired to his cabin.</p>

    <p>Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature. The starry sky,
    the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from
    earth. Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he
    has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no
    grief or folly ventures.</p>

    <p>Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer? You would not if you saw him. You
    have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but
    this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I have
    endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other
    person I ever knew. I believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing power of judgment, a
    penetration into the causes of things, unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression
    and a voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.</p>
