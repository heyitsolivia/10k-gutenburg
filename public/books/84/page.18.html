    <p>"To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses."</p>

    <p>During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only express his heartfelt
    sympathy. "Poor William!" said he, "dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had seen him
    bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the
    murderer's grasp! How much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little fellow! one only
    consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end
    for ever. A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must
    reserve that for his miserable survivors."</p>

    <p>Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered
    them afterwards in solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell
    to my friend.</p>

    <p>My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my
    loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain
    the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had
    not seen for nearly six years. How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and desolating change
    had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although
    they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a
    thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them. I remained two days at Lausanne,
    in this painful state of mind. I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy
    mountains, 'the palaces of nature,' were not changed. By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I
    continued my journey towards Geneva.</p>

    <p>The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town. I discovered more
    distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a child. "Dear mountains! my
    own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid.
    Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?"</p>

    <p>I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they
    were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved country! who but a
    native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely
    lake!</p>

    <p>Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also closed around; and when I could hardly
    see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw
    obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only
    in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of
    the anguish I was destined to endure. It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of
    the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a
    league from the city. The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor
    William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive
    at Plainpalais. During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most
    beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might
    observe its progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops,
    but its violence quickly increased.</p>

    <p>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst
    with a terrific crash over my head. It was echoed from Saleve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of
    lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant
    every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash. The storm, as is
    often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The most violent storm hung exactly
    north of the town, over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copet.
    Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Mole, a peaked
    mountain to the east of the lake.</p>

    <p>While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step. This noble war in the
    sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, "William, dear angel! this is thy funeral, this
    thy dirge!" As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near
    me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and
    discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs
    to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy daemon, to whom I had given life. What did he
    there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that idea cross my
    imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for
    support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.</p>

    <p>Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child. HE was the murderer! I could not doubt it. The mere
    presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been
    in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont
    Saleve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.</p>

    <p>I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an
    impenetrable darkness. I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of
    my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years
    had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime? Alas! I had
    turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my
    brother?</p>
