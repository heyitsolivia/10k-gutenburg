    <p>To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place
    immediately on my return. My father's age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one reward I
    promised myself from my detested toils&mdash;one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of
    that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with
    her.</p>

    <p>I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation.
    During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his
    attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and would
    he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the
    safety of my friends. I was agonized with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen. But
    through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses
    of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from
    the danger of his machinations.</p>

    <p>It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country. My journey had been my own
    suggestion, and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away
    from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval&mdash;and
    yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman's sedulous attention. She longed to
    bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent
    farewell.</p>

    <p>I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of
    what was passing around. I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that
    my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many
    beautiful and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only think of the bourne of my
    travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.</p>

    <p>After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasbourg,
    where I waited two days for Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He was alive to every new
    scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a
    new day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky. "This is what it
    is to live," he cried; "how I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and
    sorrowful!" In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the
    golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who
    observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a miserable wretch,
    haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.</p>

    <p>We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasbourg to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for
    London. During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns. We stayed a day at
    Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from Strasbourg, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz
    becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of
    beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and
    inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view
    rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the
    sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous
    towns occupy the scene.</p>

    <p>We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream. Even I,
    depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom
    of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been
    a stranger. And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had been transported
    to fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man. "I have seen," he said, "the most beautiful scenes of my
    own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly
    to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not
    for the most verdant islands that believe the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a
    tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great
    ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by
    an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have
    seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those
    wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this
    divine river that I never before saw equalled. Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on
    the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from
    among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and
    guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible
    peaks of the mountains of our own country." Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words
    and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being formed in the "very poetry of
    nature." His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed
    with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the world-minded teach us to
    look for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. The
    scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:&mdash;</p>
