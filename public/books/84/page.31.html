    <p>"The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the
    countenances of my friends. Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language,
    so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.</p>

    <p>"In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with
    innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun
    became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they
    were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never ventured abroad during
    daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I
    entered.</p>

    <p>"My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I
    improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I
    comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.</p>

    <p>"While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger, and this
    opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.</p>

    <p>"The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney's Ruins of Empires. I should not have understood the
    purport of this book had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said,
    because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory
    knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into
    the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of
    the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early
    Romans&mdash;of their subsequent degenerating&mdash;of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity,
    and kings. I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its
    original inhabitants.</p>

    <p>"These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous
    and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another
    as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that
    can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation,
    a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one
    man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of
    vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.</p>

    <p>"Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I listened to the instructions which
    Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I heard of the division of
    property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.</p>

    <p>"The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow
    creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of these
    advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed
    to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely
    ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, endued with a
    figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and
    could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far
    exceeded theirs. When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the
    earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?</p>

    <p>"I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow
    only increased with knowledge. Oh, that I had forever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the
    sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!</p>

    <p>"Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the
    rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to
    overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death&mdash;a state which I feared yet did not understand. I admired
    virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from
    intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which
    rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and
    the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively
    conversation of the loved Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!</p>

    <p>"Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and
    growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how
    all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and
    gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in
    mutual bonds.</p>

    <p>"But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with
    smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished
    nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a
    being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The question again recurred, to be answered
    only with groans.</p>

    <p>"I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story
    excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love
    and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them)."</p>

    <p>"Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was one which could not fail to impress itself
    deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly
    inexperienced as I was.</p>
