    <p>Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by
    passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason returned,
    she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be
    resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise
    sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief. Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage
    with Elizabeth. I remained silent.</p>

    <p>"Have you, then, some other attachment?"</p>

    <p>"None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and
    on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin."</p>

    <p>"My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what
    remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be small but bound
    close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune. And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear
    objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived."</p>

    <p>Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that,
    omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when
    he had pronounced the words "I SHALL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT," I should regard the threatened fate as
    unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a
    contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should
    take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate.</p>

    <p>Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would
    rather have banished myself forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than
    have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his
    real intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer
    victim.</p>

    <p>As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart
    sink within me. But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the
    countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to
    our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what
    now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and
    everlasting regret. Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a
    smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with
    seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy.
    Through my father's exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian
    government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It was agreed that, immediately after our
    union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which
    it stood.</p>

    <p>In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me. I carried
    pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a
    greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be
    regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of
    certainty as the day fixed for its solemnization drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence
    which no accident could possibly prevent.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind. But on the day that was to
    fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she
    thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the
    meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognized in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of
    a bride.</p>

    <p>After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father's, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I
    should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day.
    The day was fair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.</p>

    <p>Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along;
    the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene,
    sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Saleve, the pleasant banks of Montalegre, and at a distance,
    surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate
    her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would
    quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.</p>

    <p>I took the hand of Elizabeth. "You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If you knew what I have suffered and what I may
    yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least
    permits me to enjoy."</p>

    <p>"Be happy, my dear Victor," replied Elizabeth; "there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if
    a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me not to depend too much on
    the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move
    along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene
    of beauty still more interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we
    can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature
    appears!"</p>

    <p>Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her
    temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and
    reverie.</p>
