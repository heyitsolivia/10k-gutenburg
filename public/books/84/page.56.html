    <p>My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy. O
    blessed sleep! Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The spirits
    that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my
    pilgrimage. Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was sustained and
    inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the
    benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth's voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying
    health and youth. Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should
    come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends. What agonizing fondness did I feel for
    them! How did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that
    they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards
    the destruction of the daemon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I
    was unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul. What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know.
    Sometimes, indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated
    my fury. "My reign is not yet over"&mdash;these words were legible in one of these inscriptions&mdash;"you live, and
    my power is complete. Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold
    and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat
    and be refreshed. Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours must
    you endure until that period shall arrive."</p>

    <p>Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never
    will I give up my search until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed
    friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!</p>

    <p>As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too
    severe to support. The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to
    seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey. The rivers were covered with
    ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance. The triumph of my
    enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One inscription that he left was in these words: "Prepare! Your
    toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your
    sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred."</p>

    <p>My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and
    calling on heaven to support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean
    appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of
    the south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. The
    Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary
    of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me
    in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary's gibe, to meet and grapple with him.</p>

    <p>Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable
    speed. I know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost
    ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one day's journey
    in advance, and I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new courage, therefore, I pressed
    on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend
    and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and
    many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance. He
    had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous
    drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had
    pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be
    destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.</p>

    <p>On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair. He had escaped me, and I must commence a
    destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the
    inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet
    at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide,
    overwhelmed every other feeling. After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and
    instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey. I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the
    inequalities of the frozen ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land.</p>

    <p>I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured misery which nothing but the eternal
    sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and rugged
    mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my
    destruction. But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.</p>

    <p>By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey;
    and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and
    grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.
    Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain,
    and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a
    dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy
    when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within. Oh! With what a burning
    gush did hope revisit my heart! Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept
    the view I had of the daemon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions
    that oppressed me, I wept aloud.</p>
