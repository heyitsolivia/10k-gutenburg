    <p>"I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope. I beg permission to have a few
    witnesses examined concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be
    condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence."</p>

    <p>Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred
    of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward. Elizabeth saw
    even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when,
    although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court.</p>

    <p>"I am," said she, "the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by
    and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may therefore be judged indecent in me
    to come forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
    pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character. I am well acquainted
    with the accused. I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years.
    During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame
    Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own
    mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again
    lived in my uncle's house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was warmly attached to the child who is now
    dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,
    notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence. She had no
    temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I
    should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her."</p>

    <p>A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous
    interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence,
    charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own
    agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed in her innocence; I knew it. Could the demon
    who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to
    death and ignominy? I could not sustain the horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and
    the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony. The
    tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom
    and would not forgo their hold.</p>

    <p>I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched.
    I dared not ask the fatal question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit. The ballots had
    been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.</p>

    <p>I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before experienced sensations of horror, and I have
    endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair
    that I then endured. The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt. "That
    evidence," he observed, "was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our
    judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive."</p>

    <p>This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had my eyes deceived me? And was I really as
    mad as the whole world would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I hastened to return home,
    and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.</p>

    <p>"My cousin," replied I, "it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should
    suffer than that one guilty should escape. But she has confessed."</p>

    <p>This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine's innocence. "Alas!" said she.
    "How shall I ever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she
    put on those smiles of innocence only to betray? Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet
    she has committed a murder."</p>

    <p>Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin. My father wished her not to go
    but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide. "Yes," said Elizabeth, "I will go, although she
    is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I cannot go alone." The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I
    could not refuse. We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the farther end;
    her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone
    with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My cousin wept also.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Justine!" said she. "Why did you rob me of my last consolation? I relied on your innocence, and although I
    was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now."</p>

    <p>"And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn
    me as a murderer?" Her voice was suffocated with sobs.</p>

    <p>"Rise, my poor girl," said Elizabeth; "why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I
    believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt.
    That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a
    moment, but your own confession."</p>

    <p>"I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies
    heavier at my heart than all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was condemned, my confessor
    has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was.
    He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to
    support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do? In an evil hour I
    subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable."</p>
