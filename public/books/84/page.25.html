    <p class="poem">We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep. We rise; one wand'ring thought
    pollutes the day.We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep, Embrace fond woe, or cast our
    cares away;It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow, The path of its departure still is
    free.Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow; Nought may endure but mutability!</p>

    <p>It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the
    sea of ice. A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I
    descended upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and
    interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in
    crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert was
    exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a
    recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound
    among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in
    the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I
    exclaimed, "Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint
    happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life."</p>

    <p>As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing towards me with superhuman
    speed. He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he
    approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,
    but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight
    tremendous and abhorred!) that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to
    wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,
    combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.
    But I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to
    overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.</p>

    <p>"Devil," I exclaimed, "do you dare approach me? And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on
    your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And, oh! That I could,
    with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!"</p>

    <p>"I expected this reception," said the daemon. "All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am
    miserable beyond all living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound
    by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?
    Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If you will comply with my
    conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be
    satiated with the blood of your remaining friends."</p>

    <p>"Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched
    devil! You reproach me with your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently
    bestowed."</p>

    <p>My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the
    existence of another.</p>

    <p>He easily eluded me and said,</p>

    <p>"Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head. Have I not suffered
    enough, that you seek to increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to
    me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my
    joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be
    even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh,
    Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency
    and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen
    angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably
    excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous."</p>

    <p>"Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try
    our strength in a fight, in which one must fall."</p>

    <p>"How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy
    goodness and compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I
    not alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me
    nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many
    days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge.
    These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind knew of my
    existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?
    I will keep no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness. Yet it is in your power
    to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you
    and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion
    be moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you
    shall judge that I deserve. But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in
    their own defence before they are condemned. Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would,
    with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to
    spare me; listen to me, and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands."</p>
