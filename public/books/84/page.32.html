    <p>"The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many
    years in affluence, respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred in the service of his
    country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction. A few months before my arrival they had lived
    in a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue,
    refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.</p>

    <p>"The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many
    years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government. He was seized and cast
    into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death.
    The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and
    wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.</p>

    <p>"Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard
    the decision of the court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the
    means. After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
    unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains,
    waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the
    prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his
    deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely
    Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could
    not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and
    hazard.</p>

    <p>"The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to
    secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to
    a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the
    event as to the consummation of his happiness.</p>

    <p>"During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of
    Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts
    in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked
    him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored
    her own fate.</p>

    <p>"I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements
    of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will give them to you;
    they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to
    repeat the substance of them to you.</p>

    <p>"Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her
    beauty, she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic
    terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her
    daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of
    spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on
    the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a
    harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of her soul, now
    accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a
    country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her.</p>

    <p>"The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and
    before morning was distant many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister,
    and himself. He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house,
    under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.</p>

    <p>"Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had
    decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.</p>

    <p>"Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed
    his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event;
    and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest
    affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the
    interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country.</p>

    <p>"The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart
    he had formed far other plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared
    the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if
    he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he
    should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter
    with him when he departed. His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.</p>

    <p>"The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and
    punish his deliverer. The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison. The
    news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in
    a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved. This idea was torture to him.
    He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix
    could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely
    Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and
    Agatha by this proceeding.</p>
