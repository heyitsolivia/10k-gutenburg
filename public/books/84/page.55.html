    <p>I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not,
    of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan magistrate, whose
    mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the
    appearance of madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of
    delirium.</p>

    <p>"Man," I cried, "how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say."</p>

    <p>I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 24</h2>
    <p>My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by
    fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating
    and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.</p>

    <p>My first resolution was to quit Geneva forever; my country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me,
    now, in my adversity, became hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had
    belonged to my mother, and departed. And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have traversed
    a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries
    are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain
    and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.</p>

    <p>When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish
    enemy. But my plan was unsettled, and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I
    should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my
    father reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves. Everything was silent except the
    leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have
    been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to
    cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.</p>

    <p>The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair. They were dead, and I
    lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass and
    kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, "By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander
    near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over
    thee, to pursue the daemon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I
    will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of
    earth, which otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you,
    wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of
    agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me." I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which
    almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but the furies possessed me
    as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.</p>

    <p>I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily;
    the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter. Surely in that moment
    I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that
    I was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close to my
    ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, "I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have determined to live, and I am
    satisfied."</p>

    <p>I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk
    of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed.</p>

    <p>I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the
    Rhone, but vainly. The blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night and hide
    himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not
    how.</p>

    <p>Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track. Sometimes
    the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I
    lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I
    saw the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony
    unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which
    I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit
    of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly
    insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was
    prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of
    the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me. Often, when
    all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few
    drops that revived me, and vanish.</p>

    <p>I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the daemon generally avoided these, as it was here that
    the population of the country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally
    subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers
    by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always
    presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.</p>
