    <p>The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with
    an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained
    letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him. He said that he was wearing away his time
    fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the
    negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his
    journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to
    bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to
    meet him at Perth, that we might proceed southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I
    determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days. Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on
    which I shuddered to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must enter the room
    which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me.
    The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory. The remains of
    the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled
    the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I
    conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite
    the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones,
    and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach,
    employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.</p>

    <p>Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the
    appearance of the daemon. I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever
    consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the
    first time saw clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard
    weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in my own
    mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious
    selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.</p>

    <p>Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed
    out about four miles from the shore. The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but
    I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering
    anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly
    overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I
    listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but the air
    was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such
    agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position,
    stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound
    of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly. I do not
    know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably.
    The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found that the wind was
    northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course
    but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water. Thus situated, my
    only resource was to drive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with
    me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit
    to me. I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the
    immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a
    burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew
    before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave. "Fiend," I exclaimed,
    "your task is already fulfilled!" I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval&mdash;all left behind, on
    whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so
    despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me forever, I shudder to
    reflect on it.</p>

    <p>Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle
    breeze and the sea became free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to
    hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south.</p>

    <p>Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty
    of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.</p>

    <p>How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery!
    I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a wild and
    rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the
    shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilized man. I carefully traced the
    windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in
    a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily
    procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with me.</p>

    <p>As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding
    with joy at my unexpected escape.</p>
