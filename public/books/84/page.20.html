    <p>We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last beheld her; it had endowed her with
    loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was
    allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect. She welcomed me with the greatest affection. "Your
    arrival, my dear cousin," said she, "fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor
    guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do
    upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl,
    whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more.
    But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little
    William."</p>

    <p>"She is innocent, my Elizabeth," said I, "and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered
    by the assurance of her acquittal."</p>

    <p>"How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that
    it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing."
    She wept.</p>

    <p>"Dearest niece," said my father, "dry your tears. If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our
    laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality."</p>

    <p>We passed a few sad hours until eleven o'clock, when the trial was to commence. My father and the rest of the
    family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched
    mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless
    devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other
    far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.
    Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be
    obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty
    of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been
    considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me.</p>

    <p>The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and her countenance, always engaging, was
    rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did
    not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise
    have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to
    have committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before
    been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court
    she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw
    us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter
    guiltlessness.</p>

    <p>The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called. Several
    strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I
    had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been
    perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found.
    The woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and
    unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight o'clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the
    night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard
    concerning him. When shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The picture
    was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that
    it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror
    and indignation filled the court.</p>

    <p>Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered. Surprise, horror,
    and misery were strongly expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she
    collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.</p>

    <p>"God knows," she said, "how entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me;
    I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope
    the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance
    appears doubtful or suspicious."</p>

    <p>She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of the night on which the
    murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at Chene, a village situated at about a league from Geneva. On her
    return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She
    was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she
    was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the
    inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed
    that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum,
    that she might again endeavour to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without
    her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had
    passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain. Concerning the picture she could give no
    account.</p>

    <p>"I know," continued the unhappy victim, "how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I
    have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture
    concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe
    that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did the murderer
    place it there? I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the
    jewel, to part with it again so soon?</p>
