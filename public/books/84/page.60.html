    <p>His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sank into silence. About half an
    hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed forever,
    while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips.</p>

    <p>Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit? What can I say that will
    enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble. My tears
    flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find
    consolation.</p>

    <p>I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck
    scarcely stir. Again there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of
    Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine. Good night, my sister.</p>

    <p>Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I
    shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and
    wonderful catastrophe. I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend. Over him hung
    a form which I cannot find words to describe&mdash;gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its
    proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was
    extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to
    utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his
    face, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what
    were my duties with regard to this destroyer. I called on him to stay.</p>

    <p>He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to
    forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable
    passion.</p>

    <p>"That is also my victim!" he exclaimed. "In his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my
    being is wound to its close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it avail that I now ask
    thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot
    answer me." His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the
    dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I
    approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and
    unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to utter
    wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his
    passion.</p>

    <p>"Your repentance," I said, "is now superfluous. If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the
    stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have
    lived."</p>

    <p>"And do you dream?" said the daemon. "Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse? He," he continued,
    pointing to the corpse, "he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the ten-thousandth portion of the
    anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my
    heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned
    to be susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the
    violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine.</p>

    <p>"After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity
    amounted to horror; I abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its
    unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he
    sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was forever barred, then impotent
    envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat and resolved
    that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the slave, not
    the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable.
    I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth became my
    good. Urged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen. The
    completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!"</p>

    <p>I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of
    his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation
    was rekindled within me. "Wretch!" I said. "It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have
    made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the
    fall. Hypocritical fiend! If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the
    prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity
    is withdrawn from your power."</p>

    <p>"Oh, it is not thus&mdash;not thus," interrupted the being. "Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by
    what appears to be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery. No sympathy may I ever
    find. When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole
    being overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that
    happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am
    content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and
    opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I
    falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I
    was capable of unfolding. I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has degraded me
    beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I
    run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once
    filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the
    fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his
    desolation; I am alone.</p>
