    <p>"This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their
    store for my own consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and
    satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.</p>

    <p>"I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours. I found that the youth
    spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often took his tools,
    the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.</p>

    <p>"I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared
    greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the
    youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day,
    but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden.</p>

    <p>"By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these people possessed a method of
    communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they
    spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. This was
    indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every attempt I
    made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection
    with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. By
    great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my
    hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and
    applied the words, 'fire,' 'milk,' 'bread,' and 'wood.' I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The
    youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was 'father.' The girl
    was called 'sister' or 'Agatha,' and the youth 'Felix,' 'brother,' or 'son.' I cannot describe the delight I felt
    when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished
    several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as 'good,' 'dearest,'
    'unhappy.'</p>

    <p>"I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me;
    when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys. I saw few human beings
    besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me
    the superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his
    children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful
    accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes
    sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her
    countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus
    with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered
    more deeply than his friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of
    his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.</p>

    <p>"I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable
    cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower
    that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow
    that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where,
    to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand. In the day, I believe, he
    worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought
    no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he
    read to the old man and Agatha.</p>

    <p>"This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same
    sounds when he read as when he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which
    he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I did not even
    understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not
    sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I easily
    perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until
    I had first become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of
    my figure, for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.</p>

    <p>"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers&mdash;their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was
    I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that it was
    indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I
    am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know
    the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.</p>

    <p>"As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the
    black earth. From this time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine
    disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of
    it. Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased
    daily as the season advanced.</p>

    <p>"The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was called when
    the heavens poured forth its waters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the
    season became far more pleasant than it had been.</p>

    <p>"My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers, and when
    they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends.
    When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and
    collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path
    from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these labours,
    performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter
    the words 'good spirit,' 'wonderful'; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.</p>
