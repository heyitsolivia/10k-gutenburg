    <p>She paused, weeping, and then continued, "I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you should believe your
    Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a crime which
    none but the devil himself could have perpetrated. Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again
    in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death."</p>

    <p>"Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear
    girl. Do not fear. I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my
    tears and prayers. You shall not die! You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! No! I
    never could survive so horrible a misfortune."</p>

    <p>Justine shook her head mournfully. "I do not fear to die," she said; "that pang is past. God raises my weakness
    and gives me courage to endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as
    of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to
    the will of heaven!"</p>

    <p>During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room, where I could conceal the horrid anguish
    that possessed me. Despair! Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful
    boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them
    together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When she saw who it was, she approached
    me and said, "Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?"</p>

    <p>I could not answer. "No, Justine," said Elizabeth; "he is more convinced of your innocence than I was, for even
    when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it."</p>

    <p>"I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with
    kindness. How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than half my misfortune,
    and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your
    cousin."</p>

    <p>Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed gained the resignation she desired. But I,
    the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation. Elizabeth
    also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair
    moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my
    heart; I bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with Justine, and it was with
    great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away. "I wish," cried she, "that I were to die with you; I cannot
    live in this world of misery."</p>

    <p>Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears. She embraced
    Elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed emotion, "Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and
    only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever
    suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so."</p>

    <p>And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth's heart-rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled
    conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them. And
    when I received their cold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died
    away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.
    She perished on the scaffold as a murderess!</p>

    <p>From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This
    also was my doing! And my father's woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my
    thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral
    wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard! Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your
    early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense
    of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his
    life in serving you&mdash;he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate
    be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!</p>

    <p>Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow
    upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.</p>

    <h2 class="chapter-break">Chapter 9</h2>
    <p>Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of
    events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.
    Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse
    pressed on my heart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had
    committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet behind.
    Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions and
    thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings. Now all was
    blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction,
    and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me
    away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe.</p>

    <p>This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had
    sustained. I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only
    consolation&mdash;deep, dark, deathlike solitude.</p>

    <p>My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments
    deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me
    the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me. "Do you think, Victor," said he, "that I do not suffer
    also? No one could love a child more than I loved your brother"&mdash;tears came into his eyes as he
    spoke&mdash;"but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an
    appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or
    enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society."</p>
