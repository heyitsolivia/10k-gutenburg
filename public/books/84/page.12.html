    <p>I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be
    informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and
    you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then
    was, to your destruction and infallible misery. Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how
    dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the
    world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.</p>

    <p>When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in
    which I should employ it. Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the
    reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable
    difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of
    simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my
    ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man. The materials at present within my command hardly
    appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed. I prepared
    myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect,
    yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope
    my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. Nor could I consider the magnitude and
    complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. It was with these feelings that I began the creation
    of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my
    first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and
    proportionably large. After having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting
    and arranging my materials, I began.</p>

    <p>No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of
    success. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light
    into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would
    owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs.
    Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of
    time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.</p>

    <p>These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour. My cheek had grown
    pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement. Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I
    failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realize. One secret which I alone
    possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with
    unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my
    secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the
    lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic
    impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a
    passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate,
    I had returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the
    tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated
    from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were
    starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the
    slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,
    whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.</p>

    <p>The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit. It was a most beautiful
    season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my
    eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me
    caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time. I
    knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father: "I know that while you are pleased
    with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I
    regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected."</p>

    <p>I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment,
    loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to
    procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of
    my nature, should be completed.</p>

    <p>I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I
    am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame. A human being
    in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
    disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to
    which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple
    pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting
    the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the
    tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his country, America
    would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.</p>
