    <p>"The volume of Plutarch's Lives which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient
    republics. This book had a far different effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter. I learned from Werter's
    imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere
    of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many things I read surpassed my understanding and
    experience. I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas.
    But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the
    only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read
    of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the greatest ardour for virtue
    rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they
    were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire
    peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my
    protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity
    had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different
    sensations.</p>

    <p>"But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which
    had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an
    omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their
    similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but
    his state was far different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect
    creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and
    acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone. Many times I considered
    Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the
    bitter gall of envy rose within me.</p>

    <p>"Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered
    some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglected them, but
    now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It
    was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You minutely described in these papers every step you
    took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences. You doubtless
    recollect these papers. Here they are. Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin;
    the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest
    description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine
    indelible. I sickened as I read. 'Hateful day when I received life!' I exclaimed in agony. 'Accursed creator! Why
    did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and
    alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance.
    Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.'</p>

    <p>"These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but when I contemplated the virtues of the
    cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted
    with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn
    from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to
    despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I postponed this
    attempt for some months longer, for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should
    fail. Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day's experience that I was unwilling to
    commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.</p>

    <p>"Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its
    inhabitants, and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha spent more time in
    amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were
    contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase
    of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished hope, it is true, but it
    vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that
    inconstant shade.</p>

    <p>"I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to
    undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to
    fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathizing with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances
    breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was
    alone. I remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me, and in the
    bitterness of my heart I cursed him.</p>

    <p>"Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again assume the
    barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did not heed the
    bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief
    delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I
    turned with more attention towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer. They
    loved and sympathized with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the
    casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their
    protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see their sweet looks
    directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them
    from me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away. I asked, it is true,
    for greater treasures than a little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself
    utterly unworthy of it.</p>
