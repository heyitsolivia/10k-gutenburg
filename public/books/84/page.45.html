    <p>In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled
    from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a
    cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams,
    when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot. Presently I heard the sound
    of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.</p>

    <p>Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice, "You have destroyed the work which you began;
    what is it that you intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery; I left Switzerland
    with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have
    dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have endured incalculable fatigue,
    and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes?"</p>

    <p>"Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in deformity and
    wickedness."</p>

    <p>"Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I
    have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to
    you. You are my creator, but I am your master; obey!"</p>

    <p>"The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do
    an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice. Shall I, in
    cool blood, set loose upon the earth a daemon whose delight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and
    your words will only exasperate my rage."</p>

    <p>The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger. "Shall each man,"
    cried he, "find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had feelings of affection, and
    they were requited by detestation and scorn. Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and
    misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness forever. Are you to be happy while I
    grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge remains&mdash;revenge,
    henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that
    gazes on your misery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with the wiliness of a snake,
    that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict."</p>

    <p>"Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice. I have declared my resolution to you, and I
    am no coward to bend beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable."</p>

    <p>"It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night."</p>

    <p>I started forward and exclaimed, "Villain! Before you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself
    safe."</p>

    <p>I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation. In a few moments I saw him in
    his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves.</p>

    <p>All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and
    precipitate him into the ocean. I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up
    a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I
    had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered to think who might be
    the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge. And then I thought again of his words&mdash;"I WILL BE WITH YOU
    ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT." That, then, was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die
    and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my
    beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her,
    tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy
    without a bitter struggle.</p>

    <p>The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness
    when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last night's
    contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my
    fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me.</p>

    <p>I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden
    shock of misery. If I returned, it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a
    daemon whom I had myself created.</p>

    <p>I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation.
    When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep. I had
    been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.
    The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human
    beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the
    fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.</p>
