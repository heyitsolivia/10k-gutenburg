    <p class="noindent">"My dear Friend,</p>

    <p>"It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at Paris; you are no longer at a
    formidable distance, and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you must have
    suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most
    miserably, tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that
    your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity.</p>

    <p>"Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by
    time. I would not disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that I had
    with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet. Explanation! You may
    possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If you really say this, my questions are answered and all my
    doubts satisfied. But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this
    explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your
    absence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.</p>

    <p>"You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy. We
    were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place. We were
    affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older.
    But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate
    union, may not such also be our case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness,
    with simple truth&mdash;Do you not love another?</p>

    <p>"You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend,
    that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help
    supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your
    parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations. But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my
    friend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion. But
    it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally
    miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now I weep to think that, borne down as you are
    by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word 'honour,' all hope of that love and happiness which would
    alone restore you to yourself. I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold
    by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for
    you not to be made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request,
    remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.</p>

    <p>"Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the next day, or even until you come, if it will
    give you pain. My uncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet,
    occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness.</p>

    <p class="noindent">"Elizabeth Lavenza"Geneva, May 18th, 17&mdash;"</p>

    <p>This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend&mdash;"I WILL BE WITH YOU
    ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT!" Such was my sentence, and on that night would the daemon employ every art to destroy me and
    tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he had
    determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place,
    in which if he were victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he were vanquished, I
    should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his
    eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and alone, but free.
    Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of
    remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.</p>

    <p>Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some softened feelings stole into my heart and
    dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel's arm bared to
    drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable;
    yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction might indeed arrive a few months
    sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other
    and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.</p>

    <p>He had vowed TO BE WITH ME ON MY WEDDING-NIGHT, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in
    the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately
    after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce
    either to hers or my father's happiness, my adversary's designs against my life should not retard it a single
    hour.</p>

    <p>In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and affectionate. "I fear, my beloved girl," I
    said, "little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you. Chase away your
    idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a
    dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my
    misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of misery and terror to
    you the day after our marriage shall take place, for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.
    But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will
    comply."</p>

    <p>In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth's letter we returned to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with
    warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a change in
    her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness
    and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was. The tranquillity
    which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real
    insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent. I neither spoke
    nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.</p>
