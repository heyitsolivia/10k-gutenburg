    <p>"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."</p>

    <p>"We are not in a way to know <em>what</em> Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to
    visit."</p>

    <p>"But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised
    to introduce him."</p>

    <p>"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical
    woman, and I have no opinion of her."</p>

    <p>"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her
    daughters.</p>

    <p>"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to
    pieces."</p>

    <p>"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill."</p>

    <p>"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully. "When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"</p>

    <p>"To-morrow fortnight."</p>

    <p>"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be
    impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."</p>

    <p>"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to <em>her</em>."</p>

    <p>"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?"</p>

    <p>"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man
    really is by the end of a fortnight. But if <em>we</em> do not venture somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long
    and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline
    the office, I will take it on myself."</p>

    <p>The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!"</p>

    <p>"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. "Do you consider the forms of introduction, and
    the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you <em>there</em>. What say you, Mary? For
    you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts."</p>

    <p>Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.</p>

    <p>"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr. Bingley."</p>

    <p>"I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.</p>

    <p>"I am sorry to hear <em>that</em>; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I
    certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape
    the acquaintance now."</p>

    <p>The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though,
    when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.</p>

    <p>"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your
    girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you
    should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now."</p>

    <p>"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose," said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued
    with the raptures of his wife.</p>

    <p>"What an excellent father you have, girls!" said she, when the door was shut. "I do not know how you will ever
    make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can
    tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though
    you <em>are</em> the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball."</p>

    <p>"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I <em>am</em> the youngest, I'm the tallest."</p>

    <p>The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining
    when they should ask him to dinner.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
    <p>Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was
    sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various
    ways&mdash;with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them
    all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report
    was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
    agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more
    delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's
    heart were entertained.</p>
