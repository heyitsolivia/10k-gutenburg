    <p>"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all
    the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."</p>

    <p>In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had
    entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw
    only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
    window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.</p>

    <p>An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were
    to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in
    town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was
    quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in
    Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
    settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being
    gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring
    twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were
    comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from
    London&mdash;his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
    altogether&mdash;Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.</p>

    <p>Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His
    sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman;
    but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble
    mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten
    thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much
    handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners
    gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company,
    and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
    forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.</p>

    <p>Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and
    unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at
    Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy
    danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent
    the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was
    decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there
    again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened
    into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.</p>

    <p>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of
    that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who
    came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.</p>

    <p>"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid
    manner. You had much better dance."</p>

    <p>"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an
    assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room
    whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with."</p>

    <p>"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Mr. Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so
    many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly
    pretty."</p>

    <p>"<em>You</em> are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss
    Bennet.</p>

    <p>"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind
    you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."</p>
